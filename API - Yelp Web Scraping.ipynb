              "[(\"If more places did brunch like this, I probably wouldn't rag on it the way I do.\\n\\nAs those of you who read my reviews know, I consider brunch to be the most middling of meals. To be fair, it's a prejudice I've formed while living in San Diego, where brunch is just an excuse to wake up hung over at noon and then go swill another fifth of tequila without putting shoes on. If you're familiar with the area, check out the scene on a Saturday or Sunday in North Park sometime.\\n\\nThus, the prospect of brunch in Vancouver was not one I was looking forward to, but one I walked away from pleasantly surprised and gastronomically satisfied, thanks to the venue: Cafe Medina, a bustling cafe with competent service and delicious food. The crowd of people was also a refreshing change--all grownups behaving normally and no one swinging from the light fixtures blotto. Speaking of light fixtures, they're hung from a high ceiling that opens to a dining room, a spacious bar, a waffle station, and an open kitchen. There are industrial accents throughout mismatched with mosaic flooring, large windows, and retro wall art for a comfortable and modern vibe.\\n\\nThe pièce de résistance was the Cassoulet, a serving of two sunny-side eggs, smoked bacon, andouille sausage, Saucisson de Paris, white beans, red wine, tomatoes, and grilled focaccia. Basically it's a delicious full English breakfast in a cast-iron skillet. Every component was expertly cooked and prepared and the flavors were exceptional, from the savory grilled meats to the sweetness brought by the beans and the puréed Roma tomatoes. Breaking the egg yolk and allowing it to run into the medley beneath, then sopping it up with the grilled focaccia bread was especially delightful.\\n\\nMoving on, a certain quantity of Liège waffles are made here daily and we were fortunate to score two with accompanying dipping sauces. The iron used to make these puppies weighs 100 pounds, heavy enough to hold down rising yeasted dough. The outcome is a golden waffle that's fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, thanks to the caramelized pearl sugar that is their claim to fame. My side of white chocolate pistachio rosewater dipping sauce added an additional touch of sweetness, while my dining partner's passion fruit sauce added a welcome tart note.\\n\\nChef Jonathan Chovancek graces Cafe Medina with a menu that is classic yet bold and largely inspired by Middle Eastern flavors. As such we couldn't leave without trying the house-made sourdough flatbread paired with a serving of creamy baba ganoush. Spices and herbs are also introduced into many of the drink selections including our orders of Turmeric Elixir and Jamaiquita Lemonade. More classic brunch beverages such as mimosas are also available and priced even more affordably during Happy Hour (9 a.m. - 11 a.m. daily).\\n\\nNote that there will surely be a wait to experience breakfast nirvana so choose your arrival strategy wisely. Excellent food and artful presentation in a trendy space make Cafe Medina the full package and accomplished the unthinkable: it made me look forward to brunch here again in the future.\\n\",\n",

              " (\"Three words: Worth the wait. We were visiting from out of town and we just had to have our last meal in Vancouver here. We waited about 50 minutes for our table on a Sunday morning. We were able to put our name on the list then leave and walk around the area. Line out the door already but we had to do it (they don't take reservations). Of course we ordered a couple waffles to start. They were just as amazing as everyone stated. Crispy enough and soft at the same time. My friend got the white chocolate lavender sauce to dip and that made it even better.\\n\\nWe both got skillet dishes for brunch. I had this mushroom one that was super creamy and perfect for vegetarians (and vegans I believe...without the eggs). I loved the presentation too. My latte was also crafted perfectly. The white chocolate lavender was minimal at first but the waitress had a new one made for me without me asking (that was going above and beyond in my opinion).\\n\\nOverall, this place is a gem.

A lot of the dishes are heavy on tomato sauce. The waffles seem to be a thing in vancouver and a lot of spots have them.

All items were so good and our stomach was happy. We wish we got another waffle with a different topping because everyone around us was ordering it! They are made fresh to order and made by a lovely server at the front. The paella didn't have seafood, but it did have spicy chorizo which made us happy too. The salmon fume was just amazing.

Though, I might be slightly biased since sushi is my favorite food ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯.\\n\\nAburi Prime: 5/5\\nIt costs $58 (CAD) and comes with 9 nigiri pieces. One plate certainly wouldn\\'t make you full; however, I think it\\'s still worth trying because the sushi is top-notch. If you had to splurge on fancy sushi at least once in your life, Miku is the place to do so! The aburi prime is a preset menu and it is recommended to eat the sushi in the order of top to bottom/left to right (this is so that you go from the lighter flavors to the strongest).\\n\\nRanked in order of what I liked the most: \\n\\n-BC Sockeye Salmon: the jalapeño saikyo miso aioli was amazing and is still unforgettable in my memories\\n-Nagasaki O-toro: the toro wasn\\'t too fatty, but it was still very soft and delicious! Again, the sauce was on point :3\\n-BC Botan Ebi: the prawn comes in a slimy, creamy texture that makes it melt in your mouth\\n-Fukuoka Miyabi-Dai (snapper): has a sweet and subtle floral taste\\n-Kumamoto Kanpachi (amberjack): soft texture & light floral flavor\\n-Akami Hon-Maguro (seared brome lake foie gras): not the typical foie gras flavor & soft texture\\n-Koji Cured Gindara (sablefish): has a strong flavor due to the yuzu zest/fresh citrus\\n-Hokkaido Hotate: typical scallop - good, but not that memorable\\n-A5 Miyazaki Wagyu: soft texture & has that melt-in-your-mouth quality, but it wasn\\'t the same like the others; it was meat after all. \\n\\nTakeaway: you know the sushi is legit when it melts in your mouth and Miku\\'s Aburi Prime does just that. On top of that, each piece is beautifully decorated, making your plate aesthetic AF.\\n\\nEbi Fritters: 5/5\\nIt costs $17 (CAD) for 5 pieces, but we got an extra piece ($3.50) to split evenly between 2 people. For an appetizer, I wasn\\'t expecting much out of these fried shrimp. However, I was really impressed with how good they turned out. Each piece was pretty big and they were lightly fried with some kind of mayo sauce on top. It also comes with a small salad on the side.

As you can see from the pictures, the seared salmon is on top and there\\'s also a sushi in the middle of the rice. The pairing is perfect and will most likely cause a foodgasm in your mouth.\\n\\nGreen Tea Opera Dessert: 3.5-4/5\\n$14.50 (CAD).

The place is HUGE, immaculate, and has one of the largest staffs I\\'ve ever seen. Every member was polite, helpful, friendly, and clearly hard working. I was blown away by the treatment here. Make sure you get a reservation! And there are two bars - the sushi and the drink bar. While I enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar, it is a very different experience from other sushi bars - more flames.\\n\\nSo that takes us to one of the other reasons this place is so unique: they focus on a style of sushi called Aburi. Basically they take the fish, pair it with a sauce and garnish, sometimes flame sear it, so that you have the perfect bite. They aren\\'t kidding.\\n\\nI ordered the Aburi Prime, which comes with 9 pieces of beautiful nigiri. As the waitress was pointing out every piece, mentally I was going \"Ooh, I love kanpachi. That will be my favorite. Oh wait, Otoro! That will be my favorite.\"\\n\\nWhat happened was I took that first piece, monkfish, ate it, and said \"Wow, that might be the best piece of sushi I\\'ve eaten in my life.\"\\n\\nThe second piece was bluefin, and after eating it said \"No, that might be the best piece of sushi I\\'ve eaten in my life!\"\\n\\nIt went on like that for all 9 pieces, which were: Monkfish, Bluefin, Kanpachi, Sockeye Salmon, Ebi, Otoro, Hotate, Cured sablefish, A5 Wagyu.\\n\\nHonestly, it was a flavor ride that I thoroughly enjoyed and miss as I write this. But let\\'s be real, after eating 27 pieces at Shiro\\'s, 9 pieces, as mind blowing as they were, weren\\'t going to cut it. So after looking at the menu, I decided to go with the Miku Signature Selection, which is a mix of everything else special they do: a piece each of their Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba); a piece each of their Specialty Sushi (Miku Roll, Red Wave Roll, Garden Roll), and 4 pieces of select nigiri. It was all really good, but after having Aburi Prime, it ruined everything else.\\n\\nSo if going and a big eater, I highly recommend just ordering TWO Aburi Prime for yourself and then you can really enjoy two pieces each of that feast.\\n\\nAnd with consuming a large portion of fish and rice, I still had to get a dessert, and they all sound amazing here, especially the Green Tea Opera, which came recommended by my waitress. However it seemed a lot, so I went with what I was hoping was a simple coconut lychee sorbet.\\n\\nThey don\\'t do simple here. I got a small dessert platter full of fruit, small pastries, and the sorbet. It was another flavor ride from the biscuits to chocolate to fruit with the sorbet. \\n\\nMiku Vancouver is worth the hype - it is an overall amazing experience that any sushi fan should experience at least once.

However, I was eventually convinced by some colleagues that it would make a great brunch joint to hit up. After an hour or so of waiting, we were seated and boy, it was hard to choose just one item from the menu. At the recommendation of a colleague, I ordered the Charlie Bowl (17.00). It consisted of crispy biscuits and hash browns at the bottom topped with some cubed ham, bacon, delicious fried egg, melted gooey cheese, and their oh so amazing meaty sausage gravy. Once you puncture the egg yolk, the yolk and the sausage gravy will make each bite of the crispy biscuits and hash browns below godly. The bowl didn't look too big but holy this thing is SO HEAVY! \\n\\nWorth the wait? Mm.. maybe 20-30 minutes, but wouldn't wait an hour again.

The 4 star rating seems to be promising- at least that's what we hoped. \\nThis restaurant serves Belgian cuisine- they serve waffles, moules et frites. At $29 CDN, I'm finding the price of this dish slightly on the high side. I don't think we paid that much for mussels and fries when we dined out in Bruges. \\nSo what we settled for are the breakfast dishes. My hubby went for the Mezzes, I decided to try paella,my son went for the country side dish of cassoulet while my daughter ordered merguez et pain Morocain. \\n\\nIt took a bit for our dishes to arrive because this place is just busy. But when the dishes arrived, there was this wow factor. \\nI thought it was so creative to serve dishes in a cast iron skillet. Also, I expected short grain rice but was given orzo. The excitement only lasted a short while, though- until I dug in. \\n\\nAlthough I love their take on paella, the flavors that I'm used to in a paella was just not there. A paella should have a signature taste of saffron but this dish is terribly lacking that flavor. It really reminds me more of a pilaf. The best thing in this dish was pretty much the Portuguese linguica. The egg is cooked to a sunny side up which may not fly if you don't like your egg runny. There were veggies but they're pretty much piled up on the side as a salad. I was given this Harissa flavored condiment (is it sour cream?) on the side and I don't know what to do with it. This dish is just as confusing to me because IT IS REALLY NOT A PAELLA. \\nAlso, THE DISH IS OVERWHELMINGLY GREASY. I love that they serve the dish in a cast iron. Along that note, cast iron is low maintenance as a cooking tool because you can abuse it but it can't be washed with soap. I understand that they want nothing to stick with it but the grease is just a big turn off. Overall, the paella dish is okay but it's not worth coming back for. \\nAlong this note, we love a good cassoulet because my hubby is French. A cassoulet is pretty much your decked up bean dish and each beans should reflect the smokiness of the meats and the earthiness of the ragu and the spices. Each beans should be bursting in savory meaty and earthy flavor because a cassoulet is the Rolls Royce of all the bean dish; unfortunately, the dish my son got was pretty much okay. Perhaps this restaurant should not have called their breakfast dish a cassoulet because it's really far from that. \\n\\nOn a good note, all the sausages that came with our meals were good; my latte was exceptional and the service is great!

Order the two-tier seafood tower. It\\'s definitely worth the price if you\\'re looking for a great seafood experience. \\n\\n2. Definitely go for \"out of the water\" for the mains.

Probably because after every visit I am just laying in bed contemplating if I should visit the next day again.\\n\\nNot a resident of Vancouver city but every time I come up from Seattle I have to stop by Guu for dinner, treating myself to not only some authentic Japanese food, but also a true Japanese experience. They have an area with low tables where you can take off your shoes and sit on the floor cross-legged. So, make sure to wear socks if you happen to walk in at the time when they only have low tables open. They also have a bar area so if you come in by yourself you will most likely be seated there, quietly enjoying a delicious meal without any judgement.\\n\\nFood-wise: Their beef tataki is a must-order. I repeat, it is a must-order unless you can't stand raw beef. Squeeze some lemon juice on it and combine it with some raw onion. Oh, it just melts in your mouth. It's what makes me return to this place time after time. Usually will also order the takoyaki--the industry standard good. The last time I came back I tried the shrimp salad but didn't think it was worth it because of how little shimp you get for $10. But still, sitting at the bar area and watching the chefs put together every single dish, carefully plating and decorating them just makes me appreciate how meticulous Japanese people are. I went around Halloween and all the chefs and waiters dressed up with halloween decorations around the restaurant. Love the Japanese Izakaya vibe this place offers.\\n\",\n",

The flavors, textures, temperatures, and whatever other sensory stimuli there are were all perfect.  Each dish was uniquely different, unlike other places where they seem to be slight variations of the same base ingredients.  I would definitely order everything I ordered again, but it would be a wasted opportunity to discover the more wonderful dishes.\\n\\nSashimi salad was super fresh, and being a salad, it was kinda light (if you go easy on the sauce).\\n\\nThe calamari was the whole tentacle, and not the rings you typically see.  I'm a big fan of whole tentacle calamari due to it's crisp and crunch factor, and I don't mean from the breading.  \\n\\nThe kobocha with egg was sorta sweet, and was refreshing when eating a lot of salty foods.\\n\\nGreen beans was lightly breaded, and comes with this matcha sea salt powder which was interesting.  It was salty but earthy, which went really well with the fried green beans.  I found myself dipping other things into the matcha sea salt.\\n\\nThe garlic shrimp wasn't overpoweringly garlicky, which is a little bit of a let down because I love garlic, but nonetheless it was a great dish.  The veggies gave you something to fill up on other than deep fried stuff.\\n\\nThe mussels were cooked in this broth that was very light and clean.  They give you bowls and spoons so you could drink the soup.  When I usually have mussels, it's typically cooked in butter, wine, and garlic, and you have to use a piece of bread to soak up the juice.  Here, you could drink up the juice without feeling your arteries clog up. \\n\\nSitting at the bar and hearing the action from the kitchen was also really entertaining.  I loved the energy of the place as the waitresses were shouting orders to the kitchen, and the chefs were calling out orders, and saying hello/goodbye to people as they walked through the doors.\\n\\nI believe they have a daily menu, so every time you go could be a little different.  This place gets popping early and seating is limited, so be prepared to wait if you try to walk in.  Try making a reservation if you have a party bigger than two people.\\n\",\n",

How do you decide based on all the restaurants, which one has the best menu? Well, I love Garlic so I was already a little bit more drawn to this location than the others. Although you'll be surprised that not all of the items on the menu have garlic, darn. \\n\\nFor two people on a Sunday night, surprisingly it was pretty easy to get a table. We were a little bit overwhelmed with the specials menu because there were so many different items to order. Yelp wasn't too helpful either because everything looked very promising and delicious, I just wanted to order everything. \\n\\nThe waitress recommended several items that were very different and definitely out of my comfort zone. I was pleasantly surprised with a few of the items, but some of her recommendations were disappointing. I personally did not enjoy the Shrimp and Mochi Gratin or the Japanese Taro Potato Jelly. It's hard when you ask for recommendations for what's good and end up disappointed with what they recommend. But it's always nice to try new things so I guess it wasn't too bad. If I come here again, I'd go for the Fish Cake or Boiled Egg with Oden Soup rather than the Japanese Taro Potato Jelly. Also, instead of the Shrimp and Mochi Gratin, I'd opt for the Grilled Squid with Garlic Mayo, or the Garlic Shrimp instead. Both of those look so flavorful.\\n\\nBecause we weren't completely satisfied and wanted something with more flavor, we ended up ordering the Pork Cheek with Ponzu and the Garlic Beef Tongue. Both of these were very, very good. The Yaki Udon was great with beef and mushrooms, but flavor-wise, nothing out of the ordinary. King Salmon Belly was available as a special deluxe item. It was a bit pricey, but very smooth and buttery, you definitely can't go wrong here. \\n\\nFor drinks, I prefer Japanese Beer because it helps cut the grease from the food you're eating. If you feel like turning up and dropping more for Sake, The Dassai 39 and 50 Junmai Dai Ginjo are some of my favorites. Their cocktails were fruity and not too strong. We had the Peachy Peachie and the Strawberry Slush, which were both very sweet and fruity, also kind of perfect.\\n\\nI enjoyed sitting at the bar at Guu because you definitely get the izakaya feel. You get to interact with the chef and enjoy the drinks while watching them prepare the food. If you do come to Guu with Garlic, I recommend ordering some of the more premium items.

We were lucky enough to take a street parking nearby the restaurant - maybe it was easier than a typical day as it was in the middle of the week and raining.  \\n\\nThere were a few people lining ahead of us.  What a surprise!  We were still safe to get a Kingyo's assorted deluxe bento box.  As many already mentioned in his or her review, the restaurant only serves 10 Kingyo bento boxes a day!  \\n\\nSurprisingly, the people ahead of us in lining didn't order the bento but we ordered it for each one of us.  Although they called it as the king of lunch, it wasn't anything special - maybe I had high expectation or the reviews may have influenced me to have high expectation on it.  Now, I figured why people ahead of us ordered something else than the bento.  I'd rather order some other dishes to have a good harmony - definitely worth it to order one bento for your party but don't recommend to order one for each one of your party.  We ordered three bentos for myself and my parents.  \\n\\nFew reviews misled me that stone grilled beef tongue comes with the bento.  The answer to that is NO.  You need to order it separately, so we did it.  It was a good experience of grilling the beef tongue on stone but it was too salty - they already applied too much salt on the meat.\\n\\nOverall, it was a good dining experience but not worth it to line in to dine in.\\n\",\n",

I like that the open kitchen concept since it helped me optimize for what to try for subsequent visits. I have no regrets about eating the gnocchi twice and duck/steak once during this trip. However if I come back next things I would order are the sablefish (I overlooked seafood but one table ordered this for 3 of their 4 entrees so going to assume they know something I don't) and get the duck again, only mildly curious about the rissoto or salmon although both looked beautiful.\\n\\nUsually when I eat out, I straight up optimize for taste/value and am ambivalent to the dining experience but Fable delivered on that too, which I must begrudgingly admit won me over.

There were also smaller interactions that made me feel like the staff genuinely cared whether I had a good experience (e.g. not blanket recommending the higher-priced or daily special when asked for their opinion between two entree options, I was explicitly reminded not to tip by % when my bill included a gift card).

It was a perfect spoonful of deliciousness. The batter was light and the tartar was a refreshing balance. \\n\\nROOFTOP SERRANO PEPPERS - This appy was quite large for the 2 of us. There were about 16 small roasted peppers in a white foam, topped with some chicharron. The spiciness of peppers are always a surprise but don't worry these range between a little sweet to mildly (2/10) spicy. \\n\\nSMOKED DUCK BREAST - Perfectly cooked tender duck breast with roasted parsnip, duck confit croquette and cabbage. The croquette tasted more like a carrot, potato croquette however. \\n\\nBC HALIBUT with SHORT RIB  on pea risotto, miso and halibut dashi. This dish was my least favourite because the halibut was overcooked. The halibut was pan fried, leaving the outside crispy but the inside dry. There were only a few small pieces of short ribs but they were quite tender. The pea risotto with the dashi was tasty even with so many peas in it! \\n\\nOverall a wonderful birthday dinner.\\n\",\n",

Being a non protein main, it was a nice, generous portion. Also the reason she added the $5 glazed pork belly, which was also delicious when combined with the hazelnut beurre noisette & ricotta cheese.\\n\\nMy ling cod was perfectly cooked on one side; on the other, the skin was nice and crisp (but perhaps a bit too crisp, as the fish adjacent to the skin had hardened); this was a minor quibble as the flavour was spot on; the mashed potatoes and the cream sauce (wasn\\'t listed on the menu, maybe hollandaise?) all harmonized for a very satisfying dish... Except portion wise. Mine was so small, I stole a good chunk of the Mrs gnocchi to keep from starving.\\n\\nI realize for higher end meals to fit into a smaller budget, it often leads to dine out menus essentially being tasting menus. I would prefer a higher priced but more \"entree sized\" main.\\n\\nWe ordered 1 of each dessert... initially. Both the lemon meringue parfait and sticky date pudding were mind blowing. The lemon meringue parfait: with London Fog ice cream (yes, probably from Rain or Shine; nearby and tastes identical to theirs) and struesel, perfectly balanced lemon curd. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been hooked on trying different sticky puddings since trying Gordon Ramsey\\'s at his Steak House in Vegas (often with less than desirable results). This one was so good, that it didn\\'t need ice cream to balance it. Whipped marscopone and candied pecans added both texture and dimension.\\n\\nThey were both tiny (they\\'re served in small 2\" jars) but so good... that we ordered another one of each and swapped desserts, for an additional $7 each.\\n\\nThe food was of the highest calibre, but we left hungry.\\xa0We assumed portions had been shrunk for Dine Out, but it turns out their regular portions are that small. Based on Dine Out alone: 4.5 stars, 8.8/10.\\n\\nRecommended: the tiny but perfectly executed desserts, gnocchi, chick pea fritters.\\n\\nAvoid: arriving on an empty stomach.\\n\\nPhotos by Michelle W.\\n',\n",

The eggs? Also nothing special with a bit of standard cheese, and the hashbrown was soft and squishy as opposed to crispy.

They used to serve it with pulled pork, which I miss dearly because personally I believe it combined much better than the pork belly. \\nTheir chickpea fritters are another one of my favourites- everything is so perfectly balanced out- the garnishes (pickled onion and sprouts) compensate for the heaviness of the frying. And the sauce is absolutely delicious. \\nYou can always count on Fable for everything to be perfectly cooked (Like their poached eggs ! Always and Instagram-worthy ooze when you cut into it),\\nThere are only two downsides that I can think of. The first might be the fact that it's on the pricier side, but the quality of the ingredients and the effort and detailing given to the preparation of the food make the cost understandable. The second is that sometimes in terms of flavour, the dishes your order (if you try to switch it up from what you usually order) might be a little hit and miss, but this is probably due to the fact that everyone has different flavour preferences. There are so many specials and the menu rotates so often and changes so often that sometimes you might fall in love with a dish just for it to disappear a few months later (*insert broken heart emoji*), but at least this really demonstrates how they focus on having the freshest most in-season ingredients and that they're constantly focused on finding and showcasing the best flavours.\\n\",\n",

The chickpea fritter appeared to be a simple falafel, but it was much, much more. A potato-like and crispy textures were complemented by its golden sauce and crisp, fresh herb toppings. It was gone in two bites, needless to say.  The \"canned tuna,\" was anything but--and I can\\'t help but appreciate the effective and comedic use of irony here--consisted of fried bread and a gourmet fish dipping.

And I haven\\'t even gotten to the ribs, but when I did it was gone in an instant. Whatever the sweet, nectar-like sauce was it was an addicting flavour that I couldn\\'t get enough of. The basil surprisingly went well with the ribs and the tender, savoury beans were an excellent complement to the sweet, crispy ribs. Last but not least is the gnocchi. It is indeed non-traditional, but it is exceptional that it melts away any expectations. It pairs excellently with the smooth, white cream and the yellow squash purée to form a triage of comfort and indelible soothing softness.  To round out an already wholesome dish, soft pumpkin seeds and seared kale are added to the fray to complete this dish. \\n\\nThis was my first time at Fable, so I was not expecting anything, yet I was blown away by this culinary experience.  Not only was the food great, but so was the service. Not to mention the washroom was clean and spacious with some subtle lighting--perfect for one of those \"bathroom selfies\"...

However the accompanying sides were inconsistent. I was thrilled to be served a side of bone marrow with the dish but I would have liked some bread or some sort of carb to use to enjoy the fatty marrow with. The roasted vegetables were simply bland and the mashed potatoes were lumpy and served scooped as if it was fresh from a school cafeteria. \\n\\nAs much as I\\'d like to give The Flying Pig a higher mark, the dishes I had was overall a little inconsistent and just didn\\'t get me to four stars, however the place has a sterling reputation and the atmosphere proved it out.

You'll immediately see all the fresh oysters and other live shellfish and seafood in tanks, and you can just buy them and take home. \\n\\nOysters are all $3.50/each and $39 for the Shucker's Dozen. Happy Hour it's $1.50 for the featured oyster and $2.25 for the premium featured oyster. They also have a wide selection of seafood dishes, appetizers, and salads. Steak and Fries, Mushroom Gnocchi, and Kale Salad are the only non-seafood offerings.\\n\\nI started with three oysters and a clam: Kumamoto, Beausoleil, the East Coast Feature (Gowanbrae), and Cherry Stone Clams. I've had Kumamoto before and that's one of my favorite oysters. I just love the crisp, light brine with a sweet finish. Beausoleil was good. I liked the heavy brine, but the nutty finish just didn't seem right to me. The Cherry Stone Clam was okay. It wasn't anything special and didn't have much distinct taste besides the brine.\\n\\nThe Happy Hour Oyster was their Fanny Bay oysters. These were good. A light brine and mild taste. The East Coast feature was the same as the premium happy hour oyster, Gowanbrae. I'm definitely adding this to my favorites list! This was a bigger sized oyster that had a really nice crisp and strong brine flavor, and the finish was a clean sweet finish.\\n\\nAll oysters come with lemon, fresh horseradish, and an apple cider vinaigrette. The horseradish is freshly grated and tastes amazing! I used it on the salad we ordered because I don't want it to overpower the fresh oyster flavors. The vinaigrette had excellent, tarty flavor, but too, too strong for the oysters. Needless to say, I didn't really use much of the condiments.\\n\\nThe Baby Kale Caesar Salad was fine. There was crispy pork belly instead of  croutons, and they really felt out of place and didn't really add any anything to the salad besides tasteless, hard, dried, fatty pork cubes. The dressing was too tart and overpowering for my taste. At $15 for this seemed pretty pricey. Don't recommend this.\\n\\nOverall, the oysters were super fresh and excellent quality at good prices.

They have very interesting items displayed in the cabinets where the liquor is stored. I saw two baby alligator skulls, a boar's skull, and ... I'm going to make a guess at ... a goat's skull? Cool and creepy at the same time. While waiting for a table, I saw the bartender make some very funky cocktails. Next time when having a ladies night, I just might try a few of those!\\n\\nWhen we were finally seated we placed our order. The menu is fairly simple. They offer a select few items (the most popular simple foods such as burritos, tacos, quesadillas etc)  but a vast selection of fillings for the inside inside. \\n\\nWhat I didn't like about my dining experience tonight was that the condiment table was across the room on the other side of the restaurant. I ordered a chicken burrito. When my food arrived, I had to take my platter to the other side of the restaurant for salsa, also there were two bowls that had pickled onions and pickled vegetables. These two items were about 90% eaten. So these near empty bowls were sitting on a little side table (not sure sitting out for how long) I did scoop myself some, but I ended up no eating it just in case. \\n\\nNoise level is quite high.

I would have liked more tuna as I felt lime some times I just got all filling and no fish. It is a little bit pricey compared to the other tacos so I'd save this to try during happy hour.

It's deliciously rich, creamy and has a wonderful balance of flavours. Personally I felt like the chips were a little underwhelming and could have used more seasoning. \\nTip: remember to check when happy hour starts as I noticed some of the people who ordered stuff during happy hour accidentally got charged full price. \\nIt's a nice place for a messy date and the seating is spread far apart where you can have a decently private conversation.

La Taqueria Pinche taco shop was a great choice for us since my gf works close by. Finding the place was super easy and parking was quick as well. There is plenty meter parking along Yukon street, but we got lucky enough to go a tiny bit down W 8th to find some free parking (which is always hard to come by in Vancouver!)\\n\\nUpon entering we were greeted and were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. So we were put on a waiting list (we didn't know there was a waitlist option on yelp!) After only 10 minutes of waiting we were seated. After some debate over drinks our server was extremely nice enough to give us a sample of 2 of their top sellers. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the other drink he gave us but we ended up ordering the horchata. For food I decided to go with the Al Pastor burrito and my gf got the Baja, Pastor and Tinga de Pollo tacos. We also decided to grab some nachos topped with carnitas since we were both starving.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty much right away starting with the nachos. We were impressed right away with the thick layer of toppings and generous amount of chips. They were very meaty and had a good layer of melted cheese and sauce drizzled all over. The Horchata was very tasty and very refreshing! Shortly after we received our food. The Al Pastor was very delicious! The meat was very tasty and there was a good ratio of veggies and rice. The baja was also very good, the fish was nice and crispy and quite large. The Pastor was full of flavour and the meat melts in your mouth. And last but not least the Tinga de Pollo was delicious but slightly messy (as most tacos are!)\\n\\nOverall our experience here was very pleasant and memorable. Our server was extremely friendly and the food and service was exceptional. One thing to note is this place is a little loud so if you are looking for a more quiet and intimate dining experience, this might not be your first choice. But if Mexican is on your mind definitely stop by and give this place a chance\\n\",\n",

These oysters were as fresh as we have had anywhere. They were free of any dirt, extremely clean and refreshing. No better way to start off our meal. In addition, we also added a New England Clam Chowder. The chowder was decent, but nothing mind-blowing. Not something that we probably couldn't have gotten at any other good seafood restaurant.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Miso Marinated Sablefish, which we were told was one of their staples and most popular dishes, and the 9oz Filet Mignon with Steamed Atlantic Lobster Tail add-on. We also ordered a side of Sauteed Mushrooms and Brussel Sprouts.\\n\\nThe Sablefish was excellent and sat on top of sesame quinoa, mushrooms, edamame, kale and surrounded by sweet soy. The fish had tons of flavor in it and was still light. The miso flavor was quite prominent too. It was probably one of the best fish dishes I had eaten at a restaurant in a really long time.

              " (\"Forget bars or clubs, Thierry Chocolaterie Patisserie Cafe is THE place in Vancouver to hang out. Located just one block from the main Robson drag, it is a dessert hotspot that opens for the breakfast crowd at 7 a.m. and closes with the drunk and stumbling at midnight every day of the week.\\n\\nNamed after acclaimed maître pâtissier, chocolatier, and chef Thierry Busset, Thierry is a Vancouver institution with a sweet reputation for handcrafting petits fours, Viennoise, cakes, tarts, macarons, and exotic chocolates. They do it all in a setting that is equal parts cafe, shop, and atelier.\\n\\nAcross a handful of visits I tasted several macarons, cookies, chocolates, and shared a raspberry yuzu tart. The tart had the appearance of a classic French tart, not surprising since Chef Busset hails from France and learned the art of patisserie from masters in Auvergne and Loire Valley. However, the twist was in the ingredients. What would normally be sweet pastry cream was instead a yuzu sabayon filling which delivered a tart note, reinforced further by slivers of ginger and contrasting well with the slightly tart, slightly sweet raspberries beautifully arranged on top. Holding all of this together was a sugarcane base instead of the more traditional shortcrust pastry shell, hard and crumbly rather than hard and flaky. As a dessert it was delicious and unique.\\n\\nThe Breton, a butter cookie with sea salt, was as expected richness galore juxtaposed with salty notes. The chocolates here, meanwhile, are made in small batches in a temperature-controlled room viewable from the front of the house. They may look delicate and small, but they're rich and filled to the brim with both classic and unique fillings. My pick of pistachio (of course) featured dark bittersweet chocolate on the outside and was filled with white chocolate, pistachio, and gin, taking the ordinary and making it anything but.\\n\\nHalf orders of caramel and hazelnut 'liquid chocolate' were decadent and indulgent but thinner than I expected. I could barely discern the caramel flavor in mine. Overall the drink was less rich than anticipated, which may have worked to my advantage considering the richness of everything else I consumed.\\n\\nThe macarons here were decent but definitely denser, not as sweet, and not as chewy when compared to Ladurée, the macarons by which all other macarons are judged. To their credit, Thierry's flavors seemed to veer away from some of the more traditional ones--no pistachio, rose, or vanilla here, for example, but you will find coconut lime, lemon, and lychee. Fruit-flavored varieties have a buttercream center while others are filled with ganache, such as the salted caramel and matcha ones I tried.\\n\\nAs a venue, Thierry is both modern and comfortable, but my biggest gripe about the place is that it needs to be twice as big to keep up with demand. There are only a handful of tables inside and outside on a covered patio so if you order your dessert or drinks for here, chances are you won't be able to sit down to enjoy them. Entire groups congregate for hours in the trendier-than-Starbucks setting and even if a table miraculously opens up, it's not bussed so you'll need to eat with someone's trash and dirty dishes in your face. The entirety of the staff seems focused on taking orders and making drinks.\\n\\nThierry's popularity is partially due to the aforementioned extensive hours. While other popular dessert-centric places such as Ladurée clock banker's hours, Thierry is open late like any number of patisseries, gelaterias, and cafes in Europe where the night-life scene is about socializing without an alcohol-focused itinerary, unlike the USA. Much like Juliette & Chocolat in Montreal, Thierry evokes a classic Parisian vibe and is simply a chill place to hang out.\\n\\nIf you've been to Vancouver you also know that the city has the highest population density in Canada with over 5,400 people per square kilometer and is the fifth-most densely populated city with over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara, San Francisco, and Mexico City. Unlike sparsely populated city centers where people merely work and then flee town leaving it lifeless and deserted after hours, metro Vancouver is bustling at all hours of the day and night. Thus core businesses like Thierry serve not only tourists but also the abundance of people who live in the heart of the city.\\n\\nThierry is well worth a visit for a morning cappuccino and croissant, a leisurely lunch, or a post-dinner dessert and drink indulgence. The myriad options within bring a bit of Paris to Vancouver, but just keep in mind you might not be able to enjoy any of it sitting down.\\n\",\n",

Being extremely rich; make sure you order it if you're a sweet tooth or when you have a sugar rush and are looking for something to fulfill your sugary needs. \\n\\nIf you're looking for something on the more tart side than their fromage blanc with lemon-y tones is quite satisfying.  However, nothing beats my all-time favourite... passion fruit cake!  This cake takes you to paradise with the best of all exotic fruits.  It is a light airy mousse with a tart passionfruit gelee to cleanse the palate. \\n\\nSareena, the manager, has exceptional customer service and standards for Thierry.

This place is on a very popular street, and is definitely a HIDDEN gem.  Extra emphasis on hidden since the sign to the restaurant is so poorly lit.  \\n\\nIt's a relatively small place, with probably about 10 tables, and reservations are absolutely recommended, even at 6 pm on a Tuesday. \\n\\nAs a tofu-lover, the agedashi tofu is definitely a must-have.  Even though it's fried, the breading is super light, which keeps the tofu in a soft to medium firmness.  The gyozas were good, but they got soggy after sitting for only a few minutes, so I would pass on that.\\n\\nWe ordered almost every uramaki roll they had on the menu, and each roll was definitely on point.  Kishimoto focuses on quality sushi with quality ingredients, and they definitely delivered as promised.  Other sushi places tend to pack the rolls with rice as filler, but this place had rolls that were properly rolled with the right amount of rice to fish.  They don't drench the rolls in sauces either, so you can really taste the quality of the fish.  What I really liked the most was how light everything was, which gives you false hope that you could keep eating forever.\\n\\nThe smoked oshi is definitely a winner for the night.  Not only was it the most IG-worthy dish, it had the most intense flavor profile.  It was smoky and savory, and finished very light on the palate, even though it had some mayo-based sauce on top.  \\n\\nThe OMG roll is very economical, for the budget conscious diners.  It delivers big flavors for relatively cheap, and I could easily eat a few of those.\\n\\nWarning, the unagi oshi is very, very dense.  One of those will fill you up, so skip this if you're trying to eat more sushi.  But on the other hand, eat this first if you're trying to stay within a budget.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the 5 Kind sashimi dish.  This 10-piece combo has the usual suspects you see at other restaurants, and even though the cuts of fish were pretty generous, I would have been much happier eating 5 pieces of smoke oshi again.\\n\\nIt's a $12-$15 ride from downtown Vancouver, and is absolutely worth coming out for.\\n\\nMy only suggestion is I wish this place would serve fresh wasabi.

I've heard a lot of good things about this place so lets give it a try and see what happens!  \\n\\nWe got there around 6ish...  I thought we'd get a table right a way but the restaurant was pretty busy.  The hostess said it would be a 45 min wait!  Normally I don't wait but hey I already paid for parking and there were not a lot of viable restaurants in the area so we decided to wait.  We gave the hostess a cel number and she said they would text us when the table was ready.  We ended up going to a coffee shop in the area to kill some time.  The bad thing was that we shared a cinnamon bun!  It was super delish... and kind of temporarily deadened my appetite.  \\n\\nAnyways the wait turned out shorter than anticipated.  20 mins and we got a text saying a table was ready.

I think the rice needs to be packed together tighter.  When I pick up pieces of this dish it would invariably fall a part before I could stuff it into my gaping pie hole!\\n\\nWe ordered the O Toro dish... It's pretty small but very rich with fish oils...  actually pretty yummy... but it was not as smooth as I would have liked...  This is supposed to be blue fin tuna $40 a pop, but when I bit into pieces of the toro there was a tough ligament in some pieces that I had to deal with.  Try the toro at Sushi Hachi in Richmond as a comparison...  You'll agree with me if you tried it!    \\n\\nWe also tried the smoked oshi sushi....  I have to say nothing really special about it...  it's just smoked....  comes as advertised!  \\n\\nThe home made tofu was pretty good.  Lots of flavour and very smooth.  Almost like a dessert tofu.

Even my mom liked it and she usually thinks everything tastes the same and boring \\nMy favorite was the buttermilk fried chicken and the blackened salmon salad. The fried chicken was placed on a bed of mashed potatoes surround by a few florets of broccoli and a smear of honey mustard. Honestly, there's nothing to hate about it, the chicken was crunchy, crispy, and there's honey mustard to dip in and mashed potatoes are always welcome on my plate. The blackened salmon was suppose to be blackened trout, that's what was written on the menu, but I love salmon, so I didn't mind that I got salmon instead. It was so fresh and perfectly seasoned, however, the portion in comparison to the bed of salad under it, was sad. I'd definitely consider coming back here if I'm ever in Vancouver again\\n\",\n",

The host was very charismatic when he welcomed us in and made us feel welcomed.\\n\\nWe ordered the Bone Marrow Cheezy Bread ($13.5), Chef Erik's Veal Piccata ($25.75), Blackened Steelhead Trout ($23.75). We finished the meal off with a Lemon Tart dessert which I believe was about $7-8. The Cheezy Bread was pretty gimmicy but we had to try it because it seemed like it was THE appetizer to order. The Cheezy Bread was really yummy but the bone marrow was a little too fatty for my taste. We noticed our bone was a bit more shallow than others (probably only got 1/3 of the marrow from the bone) and we told our waiter this since we weren't able to enjoy the entire dish. He was very gracious about handling the whole thing and told us we would get another one on the house. That is customer service! We really appreciated the gesture. \\n\\nI got the Blackened Steelhead Trout and it was so refreshing! A great dish for a hot summer day in Vancouver! I would definitely recommend it. The trout was very nicely seasoned (lots of pepper) and it went well with the light dressing of the salad. Also loved the chickpeas in my dish- it went well with everything else.\\n\\nNow onto the Lemon Tart. WOW. My boyfriend and I were debating on getting that or the Creme Brulee. Get this! You won't regret it. They caramelized the sugar on top of the tart so you get this creme brulee-like crunch with a classic lemon tart flavor.

The salmon cakes were very average and a little bit dry, their only saving grace was the tartar sauce they came with (came with three cakes). Friends said poutine was very average - one said that McDonald's has poutine and potentially comparable?! YES she said it!\\n\\nI got the lobster and shrimp risotto, which was actually quite good, but one thing was missing... LOBSTER! What am I paying for? One friend got the mussels which tasted a bit off and when the waitress asked if she wanted bread with it and answered yes, she was unknowingly charged $1.50 for it. Sister got the carbonara which she stated was dry and without the bread would've been quite sad.

Not sure why the server wanted to bring everything all at once then! I hurriedly ate the squid so that the plate could be cleared,  but the empty plate sat there for most of the dinner.  The squid was also disappointing- no salt and pepper taste whatsoever, and I wasn't crazy about how limp they were.  I also hate when restaurants put their sauces in a dinky sauce dish.  IT'S NEVER ENOUGH! The lemon and dill yogurt sauce should just be advertised as what it actually was : tzatziki. The bone marrow cheezy bread is super filling (4 large triangles of cheesy bread), although I complained to my husband that there wasn't enough bone marrow to spread on the bread.  My husband said the peppercorn sauce for his steak was top notch,  but the cauliflower casserole was much too watery.  He complained that his bone marrow barely had any marrow that it shouldn't even have been served.  \\n\\nService was dismal,  I ran out of water halfway through the meal,  drank my husband's water too, and our glasses sat empty,  along with the dishes,  until pretty much the end of our meal. \\n\\nOur table overlooked the food prep area,  it was surprising how nobody had hair nets on.  \\n\\nOk meal with sub par service.

Not a chance here, we could definitely tell it was made in restaurant and it had a lot more flavours than one would be used to. After we had left, we both agreed that we could literally come back and just eat gyoza all night from Shizen Ya.\\n\\nAll of the rolls were pretty awesome. We were quite happy with the spicy tuna and dynamite rolls. I really liked the dynamite rolls too cause you could taste the shrimp and not be bothered by the other components like at other restaurants. I really liked the Natural Bomber roll. I really enjoyed the mix of crab, shrimp tempura, and avocado, plus the special sauce they used was really good too. The sauce really brought the whole roll together and I really wanted to order another one. The Sakura Blossom roll was pretty great too. Tons of sushi mainstays in one roll with crab meat, tuna, avocado, and salmon. Maybe it had too many things and I couldn't appreciate all the individual characteristics but that seems like a small complaint.\\n\\nOverall, I had a really great time at Shizen Ya. It definitely exceeded my expectations when I chose a slightly fancier sushi place. Would definitely recommend checking it out and having a nice dinner here. The gyoza again was probably the best gyoza I'll ever have. Whatever minor quibbles I have are overmatched by how good the food and service was here.\\n\",\n",

And all those handful times that I visited Cactus Club from different locations there is never a disappointment time at all! A suggestion from me to anyone who is trying to come here is to make a reservation just to be safe because from times they do get super busy, especially on the weekends. But if you don't mind having to wait 20-40 mins then go right ahead. \\n\\nCustomer service here was great, our server was super nice and she was on top with everything we asked, from refilling our drinks to making sure we were doing okay with our food. She also had conversations with us about the handful of places that are opened and different dessert places that she recommended us to try and that was a plus because any server who interact with their customers just makes everything better. \\n\\nNow! Let's get to the food, when you come here make sure to try their truffle fries and calamari for your appetizers, but make sure you share both of that dish because it can get a lot and trying to eat that by yourself won't be satisfying and sharing is caring right? The first time ever I came here I got the creole steak + prawn and that was amazing, I usually don't like getting steaks at restaurants because they never cook it to your saying but Cactus Club does a great job! Medium rare and it comes out perfect, and the meat just melts in your mouth because of how soft it is. I also recommend the Millionaire's Cut too, it is about the same as the other steak(12oz Strip-loin). \\n\\nAlso if you love some fish tacos, give their Baja Fish Tacos a try! You get 3 tacos and a side of fries, the fish is cooked perfectly. Fish inside is soft and the battered was crispy and not super crunchy. Overall, the experience is 10/10 recommend and trust me, you won't be disappointed at all!\\n\",\n",

These are raw oysters with a bit of apple, jalapeno, and foie gras shavings on top -- basically an elevated oyster. This was SO good.

The mussels were off the shell, plump, and juicy. The torn bread was AMAZING, and even more so dipped in the lovely garlic and thyme broth. I can't even properly describe it. The texture of the bread was incredible. It had crispy edges all around yet it was soft and fluffy inside. This was by far the best bread I've ever had. The torn bread (with or without the mussels) is another must try!\\n\\nFor our second entree, we ordered the 36-hour Wagyu Short Rib ($48). At such a steep price and the most expensive item on the menu, we were expecting this to also be amazing but sadly, it fell quite short of our expectations. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't worth the $48. The beef was not as tender as we had hoped it to be, nor was it very flavourful. The red wine jus was lacking in depth.\\n\\nI was still feeling a little peckish so we also got dessert to share.

I had made reservations online and also called to inform them of the birthday and asked if they could put a candle in the dessert which they happily agreed to do. Unfortunately, when the time came for dessert, they had forgotten about this request and no birthday \"flair\" was presented to my disappointment. \\n\\nWe opted for the Tasting Menu (December 2018 - $74 per person), here\\'s my breakdown and rating for each dish: \\n\\n1. Oyster with shaved foie gras (FIVE STARS) - A single oyster with shaved foie gras, two of my favourite things paired together that you typically think wouldn\\'t go well together but HOT DAMN it\\'s so good. So good that I ordered an additional two more for us to enjoy! \\n\\n2. Salad (TWO STARS) - This was one of the least impressive dishes out of the menu. It included greens, chickpea panisse, tahini, miso eggplant, pickled beet and dukkah. The selected greens were bitter and hard - it felt like eating tough grass. \\n\\n3. Fried Chicken (THREE STARS) - Fried buttermilk chicken with lemongrass aioli and pickles. My bite of chicken was quite nice, juicy and crispy on the outside. My boyfriend mentioned that his piece was over-battered and he didn\\'t get much chicken. \\n\\n4. Mussels with torn bread (FIVE STARS) - OK, so besides the oyster with foie gras, this is my next favourite dish. HOLY DAMN, the torn bread is what I imagine crack cocaine to feel like. They take a loaf of sour bread, remove the crust and put it back in the oven. The result is all the light, fluffy goodness of the inside of a bread loaf with the extra awesomeness of the crispy edges. Dipping this bread into the delicious broth was singlehandedly one of the best thing I\\'ve eaten in a long time. I will definitely come back here to have a full serving of this dish TO MYSELF (sorry, I refuse to share).\\n\\n5. Sablefish (FOUR STARS) - Another fabulous dish. Excellent flavours. The fish was cooked to perfection and was so light and buttery. The smoked whisky foam on top was AMAZING!\\n\\n6. Beef striploin (TWO STARS) - Very disappointed in this dish as we had set our expectations really high at this point. Don\\'t get me wrong, the flavours were quite good but the cut of striploin was terrible. It was full of gristle and incredibly tough to chew and eat. We had to spit out a few pieces that we could just not get down. I let our server know our disappointment and he graciously provided us complimentary dessert wines to compensate which was much appreciated.\\n\\n7. Dessert, chocolate brownies with grapefruit ice cream (THREE STARS) - Good but the grapefruit ice cream overpowered the other flavours (coming from a grapefruit fan!) \\n\\n8. Dessert, three different dessert bites (THREE STARS) - Chocolate truffle, piece of caramel and a beignet.

So let's get into it!\\n\\nLet me start by mentioning that if this is what traditional Italian is like, then I am not a fan of traditional Italian lol.  \\n\\nSo we started off by ordering the arugula salad which had way too much lemon, I mean, a friend and I were sharing and didn't really think it was that great.  It was arugula drenched in lemon juice. I could not and would not finish it.\\n\\nWhat I did enjoy was the crostini. The had a special daily flavour that day, so we tried a few off the regular menu (walnut pesto)  and the daily. For my main I ordered gnocchi because I love gnocchi, but I was disspointed.   I ordered the butter and hazelnut and it was flavourless.  I took a few bites, but I firmly believe that if you don't enjoy your food, you shouldn't force it down no matter the price, no matter what the restaurant thinks.  The waitress noticed and offered me something else and I opted to get more crostini because it was very flavourful and was the only good thing I tasted so far. \\n\\nSo I was told after that the gnocci had ricotta cheese instead of potato.  Why isn't that written on the menu, because I think most people are expecting the potato filling.  When I mean bland I mean like, no salt anywhere and I even think it was made with unsalted butter.\\n\\nI also didn't really like our service.  I thought the waitress was really trying to get us out of there. I felt like she was rushing me and I found that very annoying.  \\n\\nSo like I said, if traditional Italian is flavourless and bland, then I like Americanized Italian.  \\nI don't see myself coming back.\\n\\nSide note: this is way down Robson street. The address can be a little misleading.  It's not anywhere near a train.\\n\",\n",

The fresh mozzarella was almost buttery and the prosciutto was amazing because it wasn't as salty as the grocery store kind. The walnut pesto and pear crostini was a light starter with and good for what it was.\\n\\nWe then ordered the linguini with anchovies and garlic for my husband, and tonnarelli caio e pepe (spaghetti-like noodles lightly tossed in butter and arugula leaves with light dust of parmesan cheese and black pepper) for myself. Both entrees really hit the spot for authentic Italian comfort food alongside with our screwdriver and Bellini.\\n\\nThe overall ambiance is super upbeat and the decor is so unique. My husband pointed out there were pig statues, figurines, pictures, and stuffies all around the restaurant so we just assumed since the served things such as prosciutto and pulled pork that would be the reason why. When a server came to give us our food I asked him and he said they have been gifts from different customers even dating back to when they first opened and one pig just led to another. We thought that was really interesting so who knows, maybe we'll bring another pig to add to their collection seeing as we'll be returning for the food anyways!\\n\",\n",

It's their classic tonkotsu broth + white sesame oil and roasted sesame seeds and six slices of chashu. I added a soft boiled egg for $1.75. You can also customize noodle thickness, noodle firmness, broth thickness, broth richness, and spiciness. I do appreciate that, even if all the choices seem a bit overwhelming when they're asking you.\\n\\nThey're quick with the food here. Within minutes of ordering, I had a steaming bowl of ramen in front of me. My first bite of the chashu had me regretting ordering the chashumen with 6 slices of chashu. I was not a fan, as it was a bit dry. Good chashu should be really tender and melt in your mouth. The rest of the bowl was fine (and I loved the soft boiled egg), but because I was eating the dry chashu with every bite, I didn't particularly enjoy the meal.\\n\\nNext time I want ramen, I'll go back to my personal favorite in the area, Marutama.\\n\",\n",

Their ramen reminds me of the infamous Ichiran Ramen in Japan... even though I've never had Ichiran Ramen but it looks very similar to that... that would be my best description of their ramen \\n\\nService 5/5: the staff is extremely attentive and they would greet me when I walked in and sat down and I was greet when I left the restaurant as well. \\n\\nLine-up: Yes, there is a huge line-up every day at this ramen shop. I've waited 20-40mins on average. I waited for less time when I ate alone because it was easier to accommodate one person seat versus a table for two. \\n\\nLocation: There are two locations. I've only been to this downtown location. It was convenient for me because it's close to the tourist attractions including Canada Place. This location is along Robson Street aka my favourite street in downtown Vancouver because they have so many restaurants. I would walk up and down this street and scout for places to eat.\\n\\nDecor: it looks like a Japanese ramen shop. I love their stools because they double as storage... \\n\\nFood: 5/5 I love their broth. It's very fragrant and you can tell that they make fresh broth. Also they do a good job blanching their pork bones because the broth was very clean and didn't taste gamey. You can customize things such as the firmness of the noodles, amount of hot sauce  because they give you a sheet where you circle your preferences for each item. Also their egg is so soft and runny and it melts in your mouth. I like my noodles extremely firm and I love how they made my noodles extra firm each time \\n\\nPortion: Their portion is really tiny so I would pay for extra noodles. I never feel bloated or 100% full even after adding extra noodles and drinking all the broth. If you eat more than the average person, you might want to get a snack afterwards. \\n\\nRecommend? Yes!

New restaurant? Nope. Free food? Nope. George Clooney in the building? I wish. Normally in America I\\'d question the long line and think \\'hype,\\' but this is Canada, and Canadians aren\\'t stupid.\\n\\nThe original Danbo shop opened in 2000 in the town of Chikushino located halfway between Kurume on the southern island of Kyushu and Hakata in the Fukuoka Prefecture, the epicenter of Tonkotsu-style ramen. They focused on quality and taste and soon word spread, and so did they--all over Japan. This Robson store is one of four in North America (the others are in Seattle, Brooklyn, and a second in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver).\\n\\nThe ramen here is build-your-own and customizable to the hilt, which aside from the exceptional taste of the broth, is Danbo\\'s biggest claim to fame. In most ramen shops I\\'ve been to, you can choose your protein or vegetal toppings. Here you pick everything from noodle thickness and firmness to the amount of lard, richness, and spice in the broth. At first, the level of choice was overwhelming. If the thought of endless possibilities makes you run for the hills, just order \\'standard everything\\' and call it a day. Normally I advocate for the purveyor to dictate the vision for how their food should taste, but in this case, it was kind of cool to granulize, particularly to control the lard. I went with a \\'light\\' quantity of that but you have up to an \\'extra rich\\' on the Richter Scale. To quote the late great Julia Child, \"fat gives things flavor.\" Over time it can also cause a coronary, so everything in moderation is my motto.\\n\\nSimply put, my order of Miso Rekka Ramen was superb, arriving prepared with chashu (pork), scallions, and a dollop of their top-secret homemade karadare (spicy sauce). \"Rekka Ramen\" means that an additional layer of Ichimi Togarashi Powder gets added, which did its job to bring extra heat while not overpowering the flavor of the broth. Speaking of broth, Danbo\\'s is based on a starter Tonkotsu pork broth and was savory without being salty or oily. The miso ramen builds on the base by using a blend of two types of traditional Japanese miso. Swirled within the broth were super fresh and firm thin noodles that had a nice chew. Meanwhile the locally sourced Yakibuta Chashu pork had both crisp and melt-in-your-mouth tender textures. Collectively, it was umami heaven, and in addition to being tasty, I imagine this hot bowl of happiness works well when Vancouver is sporting negative temperatures.\\n\\nWanting to experience more magical porky savoriness, we also shared an order of Chashu Pork Donburi, served as a small bowl of white rice topped with small chunks of tender pork belly. The braised chashu boasted even layers of meat and fat topped by fresh scallions and a savory sauce. This was a satisfying side dish and served to reinforce the high brought on by the ramen. Just when you don\\'t think it can get any better, it does. \\n\\nThe catch at reaching ramen utopia is that you have to wait, but typical of ramen shops, rest assured that the food here is efficiently served and the line moves quickly. Unlike the fast-casual places where there\\'s one register open just to create a line and thus the appearance of popularity, this is a full-scale sit-down place that\\'s turning over tables as fast as possible. After all, you sit, slurp, pay, and leave.\\n\\nThis is easily the best ramen I\\'ve had up to now and puts everything I have back at home squarely in the \\'this is crap\\' category.

A super simple dish, but if you're a truffle lover, I highly recommend...they bring the truffles to the table and shave them onto your pasta, right in front of you, in what I would consider to be a generous amount!\\nWhile the orange almond cake probably isn't their most popular choice, I really loved the flavours of the dessert. The cake was extremely moist and the citrus flavour was just what I needed to round out a richly flavoured dinner. \\nWe enjoyed Prosecco by the glass, some burrowing owl white Chardonnay, and for our anniversary, they topped us off at the end of the meal with complimentary ice cold moscato - we thought this was a really nice and refreshing touch! \\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience and a place for special occasions, celebrations, or intimate date night.

I've been wanting to try their lunch burger for a while so that was fine.\\n\\nWhen I arrived, there was no hostess in sight. It was 12 noon and that's the time I expect most lunch goers to be strolling in so it was weird that no one was at the front. I waited for while and even walked in but no one came to the front. Since I made a reso and was already had my mind set on dining here I stayed and finally someone came. After checking me in, I was seated and my server arrived. \\n\\nSince they only serve their brunch menu on weekends we ordered the burger (4/5) and the parmesan chicken sandwich (2.5/5). \\n\\nThe burger was good and I had at medium which was the recommended cook by our server. It was perfectly layered and wasn't messy to cut. \\n\\nThe chicken sandwich on the other hand was quite disappointing. It was quite dry overall. It screamed for sauce of some sort of greens. It did come with some slaw on top but it didn't help much. It also was very flat in taste. \\n\\nBoth sandwiches came with fries but the batch that came with the chicken sandwich was overly salty and we just ate from the other batch. \\n\\nApart from the unavailable prix fixe lunch menu, no hostess and long wait at the door, service at the dining room was lacking as well. I asked for lemon to go with my water and it was forgotten. I had to ask again and it was lemon wedges which was different from the lemon essence I got during my first visit. Also when walking to the washroom I noticed the other table having the essence.... so difference in treatment kind of threw me off. Service at such venue is important to me so I have to drop them by one star.\\n\",\n",

So people must know something, we figured, so we gave it a try. Even on a weekday with pouring rain, it was still a good 40 minute wait because they only have half a dozen tables -- and people linger to enjoy the food.\\n\\nThe sushi is fantastic. We're both Japanese and both agreed that it was some of the best sushi we've had in the States.

Poutine is great, and La Belle Patate's regular poutine is great as well. \\n\\nSmoked Meat Poutine\\nRegular poutine on steroids. If you're craving smoked meat, get this, and not the sandwich. \\n\\nSmoked Meat Sandwich\\nStick to the poutine. While the smoked meat sandwich was tasty, it was nothing to write home about. Make the right choice and get the poutine from a poutine joint. \\n\\n[Value] \\nEach poutine was under $12, and for the size of it, it's pretty good value. I wouldn't say it's cheap, but it is good value for your money. \\n\\n[Atmosphere/Service]\\nIt's a sports bar atmosphere, they'll likely have a football game on, and a handful of people actually there to watch the game. Service was fast and efficient, and friendly enough for a quick service restaurant.\\n\",\n",

The 4 star rating seems to be promising- at least that's what we hoped. \\nThis restaurant serves Belgian cuisine- they serve waffles, moules et frites. At $29 CDN, I'm finding the price of this dish slightly on the high side. I don't think we paid that much for mussels and fries when we dined out in Bruges. \\nSo what we settled for are the breakfast dishes. My hubby went for the Mezzes, I decided to try paella,my son went for the country side dish of cassoulet while my daughter ordered merguez et pain Morocain. \\n\\nIt took a bit for our dishes to arrive because this place is just busy. But when the dishes arrived, there was this wow factor. \\nI thought it was so creative to serve dishes in a cast iron skillet. Also, I expected short grain rice but was given orzo. The excitement only lasted a short while, though- until I dug in. \\n\\nAlthough I love their take on paella, the flavors that I'm used to in a paella was just not there. A paella should have a signature taste of saffron but this dish is terribly lacking that flavor. It really reminds me more of a pilaf. The best thing in this dish was pretty much the Portuguese linguica. The egg is cooked to a sunny side up which may not fly if you don't like your egg runny. There were veggies but they're pretty much piled up on the side as a salad. I was given this Harissa flavored condiment (is it sour cream?) on the side and I don't know what to do with it. This dish is just as confusing to me because IT IS REALLY NOT A PAELLA. \\nAlso, THE DISH IS OVERWHELMINGLY GREASY. I love that they serve the dish in a cast iron. Along that note, cast iron is low maintenance as a cooking tool because you can abuse it but it can't be washed with soap. I understand that they want nothing to stick with it but the grease is just a big turn off. Overall, the paella dish is okay but it's not worth coming back for. \\nAlong this note, we love a good cassoulet because my hubby is French. A cassoulet is pretty much your decked up bean dish and each beans should reflect the smokiness of the meats and the earthiness of the ragu and the spices. Each beans should be bursting in savory meaty and earthy flavor because a cassoulet is the Rolls Royce of all the bean dish; unfortunately, the dish my son got was pretty much okay. Perhaps this restaurant should not have called their breakfast dish a cassoulet because it's really far from that. \\n\\nOn a good note, all the sausages that came with our meals were good; my latte was exceptional and the service is great! My hubby loved his dish Mezzes and so did my daughter. \\n\\nWe might go back someday to try the waffles. We're not in a hurry though. \\nService 4\\nAmbience 5 \\nTaste 2 \\nPrice 3\\n\",\n",

I replied dinner (as we came to eat) and we were seated at the bar then advised they did not have a liquor license for this half of the establishment.  Not a huge deal but seeing other seating around us, we relocated to the communal table.  \\n\\nMy baseline for mexican restaurant reviews is the burrito so I selected their Carne en Adobo burrito.  I like the presentation and enjoyed the taste of the corn chips that were added to the burrito.  Unfortunately I found there was too much of the cabbage/lettuce combination relative to the meat.  At $13.75, it was ok value but there are better burritos out at cheaper prices.  There was no issue with the service and we had two servers that were attentive and pleasant.\\n\\nIt was a positive food experience and if I was to return it would be to sample their Happy Hour offerings.\\n',\n",

They have very interesting items displayed in the cabinets where the liquor is stored. I saw two baby alligator skulls, a boar's skull, and ... I'm going to make a guess at ... a goat's skull? Cool and creepy at the same time. While waiting for a table, I saw the bartender make some very funky cocktails. Next time when having a ladies night, I just might try a few of those!\\n\\nWhen we were finally seated we placed our order. The menu is fairly simple. They offer a select few items (the most popular simple foods such as burritos, tacos, quesadillas etc)  but a vast selection of fillings for the inside inside. \\n\\nWhat I didn't like about my dining experience tonight was that the condiment table was across the room on the other side of the restaurant. I ordered a chicken burrito. When my food arrived, I had to take my platter to the other side of the restaurant for salsa, also there were two bowls that had pickled onions and pickled vegetables. These two items were about 90% eaten. So these near empty bowls were sitting on a little side table (not sure sitting out for how long) I did scoop myself some, but I ended up no eating it just in case. \\n\\nNoise level is quite high.

The first floor had a few split-levels and it looked like the tables were cascading towards the front doors. There were cozy little nooks and also seating upstairs that over looked the entire restaurant. A very nice set up. One thing I didn't like was that the bathrooms are upstairs. This is my 3rd time here. My first time was decades ago when I myself was 19 and the 2nd time was about 10 years after that for another bday celebration. \\n\\nThere were a few mistakes made on our dinners but all were corrected. The Caesar salad came without dressing. The clam chowder soup was luke-warm. My son ordered his steak rare but it arrived raw on the inside. The big one was a dish we ordered didn't arrive but because we had ordered so much food that I didn't realize it until the next day. I called and they immediately took care of it by issuing a refund for the missing dish. Our waitress was professional but I felt she lacked some knowledge of the food and beverages. We asked for recommendations for drinks and ended up with something totally opposite of what we wanted i.e. we asked for a suggestion on a fruity drink, what she recommended (and we ordered) was not fruity at all and was so strong it cleared my nostrils instantly.\\n\\nOver-all the food was tasty and the ambience was beautiful. However I was a reminded why it's a good decade+ between my visits to Joe Fortes. It was a very expensive evening for what it was. There are other restaurants that are just as classy and the food just as tasty at 1/3 the cost.\\n\",\n",

              " (\"Lively atmosphere, great service and solid food.\\n\\nWe swung by for a 8pm reservation on a Saturday evening and, as you would think with an establishment like Joe Fortes, the restaurant was very crowded. Almost every table was taken at the restaurant, so either it was really good or every one who thinks their really good is a sucker. In our humble opinions, we're all in between.\\n\\nFirst, it was LOUD in the restaurant. People of all ages were dining here, but it seemed a majority of the crowd that evening was on the trendier side. Actually, it might have just been one group making all of the noise, but nevertheless it was still loud when they left, just not as loud.\\n\\nThe menu was as big as any restaurant we'd ever been to with an emphasis on seafood (fish and lobster) and meats (steaks and chops). With it being our first and, potentially, only time at Joe Fortes, we didn't hold back during our last vacation dinner.\\n\\nTo start off our meal, we ordered a dozen raw oysters. These oysters were as fresh as we have had anywhere. They were free of any dirt, extremely clean and refreshing. No better way to start off our meal. In addition, we also added a New England Clam Chowder. The chowder was decent, but nothing mind-blowing. Not something that we probably couldn't have gotten at any other good seafood restaurant.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Miso Marinated Sablefish, which we were told was one of their staples and most popular dishes, and the 9oz Filet Mignon with Steamed Atlantic Lobster Tail add-on. We also ordered a side of Sauteed Mushrooms and Brussel Sprouts.\\n\\nThe Sablefish was excellent and sat on top of sesame quinoa, mushrooms, edamame, kale and surrounded by sweet soy. The fish had tons of flavor in it and was still light. The miso flavor was quite prominent too. It was probably one of the best fish dishes I had eaten at a restaurant in a really long time. Just perfectly cooked and not dry. The quinoa, mushrooms, edamame and kale rounded out the entree nicely. I absolutely devoured it all.\\n\\nAs for the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail, they were also really good. It's really tough to screw either one up and Joe Fortes cooked them just right. This was my wife's dish and I had pieces of both, but she found it to be delicious.\\n\\nThe sides, on the other hand, were on the salty side. It was unfortunate because we were looking forward to the mushrooms and sprouts, but they were just too salty to want to continue eating after we were full. A definitely disappointment.\\n\\nBesides the above average food, the service was great. Our waiter, an Asian male, was fantastic throughout the evening. He answered all of our questions and also gave us all of the information we needed to make our ordering decisions.\\n\\nI'm not sure what to make of Joe Fortes, but I got the feeling it was a tourist hotspot. However, the food was good, but a tad pricier than preferred. Would I say it's a must visit though? Probably not. The food scene is great in B.C. and there are so many great restaurants. Even though the food was good, I didn't feel that everything on the menu seemed like it was that special. I came away feeling I could have ate the food here anywhere, but Joe Fortes seems like one of the places to go to when in town.\\n\",\n",

I was a little hesitant to order them because the ones served with the calamari weren't crispy enough and tasted a little bland.

The server asked if we'd be ok getting the dishes all at once,  we agreed,  however,  the table was WAY too small for all the dishes.  Not sure why the server wanted to bring everything all at once then! I hurriedly ate the squid so that the plate could be cleared,  but the empty plate sat there for most of the dinner.  The squid was also disappointing- no salt and pepper taste whatsoever, and I wasn't crazy about how limp they were.  I also hate when restaurants put their sauces in a dinky sauce dish.  IT'S NEVER ENOUGH! The lemon and dill yogurt sauce should just be advertised as what it actually was : tzatziki. The bone marrow cheezy bread is super filling (4 large triangles of cheesy bread), although I complained to my husband that there wasn't enough bone marrow to spread on the bread.  My husband said the peppercorn sauce for his steak was top notch,  but the cauliflower casserole was much too watery.  He complained that his bone marrow barely had any marrow that it shouldn't even have been served.  \\n\\nService was dismal,  I ran out of water halfway through the meal,  drank my husband's water too, and our glasses sat empty,  along with the dishes,  until pretty much the end of our meal. \\n\\nOur table overlooked the food prep area,  it was surprising how nobody had hair nets on.  \\n\\nOk meal with sub par service.

By the time 30 minutes go by, I ask one of the waitress in passing how long will our order take? She said that she will go check on it. She goes and doesn't come back...

Well, Dinesty Dumpling House in Vancouver didn\\'t quite come close either.\\n\\nThis place is on the touristy Robson Street next to a couple of other Chinese restaurants. It was pretty busy when we went there, and something I noticed immediately was that almost all the customers are not Chinese. While I\\'m not saying that\\'s a bad thing, it\\'s not a good thing either. This restaurant was closest to our hotel, and we didn\\'t want to drive down to Richmond even though we felt it might a better experience.\\n\\nThe interior was nice and modern. I liked that the kitchen was viewable with the glass wall, so you can watch them prepare the dumplings.\\n\\nThe menu is a lot more extensive than I imagined. You literally get a giant picture book. Besides the Xiao Long Bao, there\\'s also steamed and pan fried regular dumplings, buns, savory cakes, and spring rolls. Their main entrees hits all the main meats, fish and seafood, fried rice and noodles, soups, and desserts. And there\\'s a breakfast menu too! It was extremely difficult to decide what to eat as I want to try everything!\\n\\nI guess Xiao Long Bao is a must since that is what Dinesty is known for. All the dumplings will have pork. We ordered one with crab meat and another with XO Sauce. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a Vancouver thing that many Chinese restaurants lack taste and flavor, but these dumplings were really bland and oily. When I bit into the crab meat one to drink the soup, it was mostly oil with a hint of pork and crab taste. The meat filling barely had any taste. The pork was under seasoned and there wasn\\'t enough crab inside to even have its taste. The XO sauce was surprisingly even more bland!! How is that even possible especially when you\\'re using XO sauce?? Well, it is! The pork is already under seasoned and there was just the smallest hint of XO sauce taste, and that was really from the large pieces of dried shrimp. I ordered the XO sauce one believing there\\'ll be enough taste since XO sauce is very tasty. I was so disappointed! As for the dumpling skin, it was on the thick and doughy side. Sure making it thicker and doughy holds the soup more securely, but the thinner and less doughy yields a better eating experience.\\n\\nWe also had the Spicy Pig\\'s Ears. This was really off the mark. The only tastes were green onions, sugar, and a lot of chili oil. The pig\\'s ears were mostly stuck together and was difficult to separate. We like to slowly eat it. Eating one piece would\\'ve been a third of the plate. But they tender with the nice cartilage bite. This needed some soy and vinegar.\\n\\nLastly, we ordered the Summer Chicken with Basil in Triple Sauce. When I seen the words \"triple sauce,\" I thought, \"this HAS TO BE tasty, right?? Right??\" Well, even with octuple sauce, it\\'ll still be bland. Sauce still needs salt and sugar and seasoning! While the chicken was nice quality and cooked very well and the outside layer of the chicken had some flavor from the sauces, the inside of the chicken had zero taste. The basil in this dish was non-existent. There was no herbaceous and brightness that you get when you\\'re stir frying with basil. All this dish needed was salt and salt to marinate the chicken.\\n\\nOverall, I was fairly disappointed. I had high hopes for Dinesty Dumpling House, but it fell short of expectations. The food wasn\\'t awful or inedible. It just lacked seasonings, taste and flavor, and everything was on the oily side. The staff here were just attentive. Not exactly friendly or courteous. I like they have such an extensive menu and would like to try other things, but it\\'s really on the pricey side as I feel all the restaurants on Robson Street are on the pricey side since this is my third place here. I think the Dinesty\\'s in Richmond may be better, but not sure. We will see next time!\\n',\n",

You can adjust the richness of the broth by selecting from 3 levels (light, medium, and rich). Also the pork has two levels of fat and lean. The medium and light miso broths were a little on the bland side. The medium spicy garlic was better and not too spicy. For the pork, the fat option is better but the lean would be smarter for the health conscious. I wasn't a fan of the heaping of bean sprouts as it ended up making the broth taste even more bland.\\n\\nOverall, a decent ramen joint but there are definitely better options in the area.

Our drink arrived within 5 mins of ordering. The drinks are ok. Food specials are limited to 50% off appies and burger. \\n\\nWhen our server came around the second time we ordered the Pourhouse Burger with the egg as suggested by other reviews (reg. $23+2[egg]. HH pricing $12.50). The burger arrived in 12 mins. \\n\\nThe burger was smaller than expected - just about a half diameter bigger than the ketchup dish. The egg did nothing to add to the taste or texture as the Patty and the bacon is greasy enough to soil 10 napkins. The burger tastes alright, but nothing really special or amazing. Even at $12.50 I felt that it could be better.\\nThe fries were alright, but way too salty for my taste.\\n\\nOverall, we will likely not come back for their HH as their appies and drinks selection are limited...and frankly ok in taste for the price.\\n\",\n",

We gently brought it to our (very pleasant) server\\'s attention (in question format), and she returned hurriedly with what was ostensibly a cash refund of the difference. Fair enough. Problem solved. Outtie.\\n\\nOn our way out, my gf decided to go back in briefly to retrieve the receipt off the table, just to make sure the bill correction was accurate (since it had not been clearly explained). While she did this, I waited near the front desk quietly, at which point the maître d\\' cheerfully asked me how our dining experience had been. Since she asked, i said politely: \"it was very tasty, and our server was great, there were just some discrepancies with the bill.\" She said: \"oh i\\'m sorry to hear that\" and asked what the problem had been.  I lightheartedly explained what happened, and also mentioned (this was my pet peeve) that i was charged $4 for soda water, after receiving a refill on a soda that was still half full. \\n\\n(My mistaken assumption upon agreeing to a refill had been that if the soda was still half-full, and i was being cheerfully offered another, it wasn\\'t going to be $2 per glass. ...

However, I felt like this was a very average/mediocre meal, and I thought it was going to be more upscale and special. Perhaps I should have ordered something else, but I was not impressed with my Feenie Burger for $19 CAD.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night and it was quite busy. Luckily we were able to get a table quickly, though I really didn't like the table that we got. While outdoor heating is appreciated in Vancouver's cold winter weather, the heating lamps above our table made it so uncomfortably hot. I felt like I was turning into old dried food sitting under a hot catering lamp! It was roasting hot.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my Feenie Burger wasn't tasty enough to distract me from the uncomfortable heat. The burger was a tad dry and the smoked bacon seemed low-quality due to the thinness of it. The fries also needed additional seasoning as I had to drown them in ketchup. Luckily, the sauteed mushrooms had a nice texture to them and made the burger a tad moister.\\n\\nOverall, this was a subpar dining experience, but I can see why this place is popular. Other dishes that came out looked quite tasty and I liked the trendy atmosphere. I won't visit this place for food if was vacationing in Vancouver again, but perhaps I'd come for drinks. My pina colada was delicious, even though it was dairy-free! The texture was smooth and the ice was perfectly blended in. My pina colada was the highlight of my meal here.\\n\",\n",

Located right on the waterfront, this little outdoor shack was frying up the fish and serving it as quick as possible.   Limited outdoor seating made this a risk for us as the weather wasn't that great.  Luckily the rain started to drop as we were cleaning up.  Small basic menu of cod, salmon or halibut fried things, tacos, soups, and salads.  We had 2 platters with two pieces of fish each ($19 and $14) and a salad to share ($8).  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of my cod but the halibut my hubby had was cooked to perfection.  There was absolutely no flavor or seasoning in the batter though so you're really just eating bland battered fish.  The slaw and the salad dressing were very good.  I ended up sprinkling the dressing left from the slaw on my fish to finish it up.  They had a few canned sodas but no bottled waters for sale.  They did have a water jug with free water, but the cups were tiny.  With the big crowd, it was a pain to get back to it for a refill.\\n\\nWhile the service was friendly (dude taking our order sounded like Armie Hammer, lol), the food was only ok.  $50 for two plates and a basic salad would make me choose something else if we came back to Granville Island.\\n\",\n",

Operationally not run well - Aberdeen location seems to be run much more efficiently with more staff and more space.\\n\\nFood 5/5\\nValue 4/5\\nService 2/5\\nLocale 2/5\\n\\nLast year I wrote a raving 5 star review of Sura's Aberdeen location, comparing Sura to Din Tai Fung. I came here with similar expectations, and while the food and the lunch set pricing were the same, there were lots of differences between this Robson location and Aberdeen:\\n\\n1) Wait time of 40-60 minutes were given at 1230pm. Took a little over an hour wait to be seated. You can expect your true wait time to be closer to the upper bound of whatever time range the host gives you.\\n\\n2) While waiting, we observed at least 2 (perhaps more) tables left unseated for more than 15-20 minutes during high peak chaos at lunch hour. It was hard to tell whether if the hostess was not aware of the open seats, whether if s/he was too busy, or whether if there weren't servers, etc. \\n\\n3) Since I waited a whole hour, I stood and watched closely how staff operated that day. At any given time, at least 1/3 of the staff was in the back, congregating near a cash register and/or a person who appeared to be the manager (or shift supervisor, or owner, etc.). There seemed to be a major bottleneck operationally in terms of receiving orders and efficiently deploying people out to their jobs. It looked like staff members had to continually check in with a certain one person with every decision, which slowed down the whole entire team. \\n\\nDue to the price, cuisine, and the location, it wouldn't shock me if this location of Sura could fill a dining hall twice the size of its current facility. I think there is literally that much demand to fill for this restaurant. I saw time and time again many numerous people come, hear the wait time, and then simply give up and leave because the waiting area was packed and waiting times were too long. \\n\\nShort of buying up and/or leasing the building next door and expanding, here are some tips I would suggest management to change in order to better process customer flow in the dining hall given with the staff at hand:\\n\\n1) Do not seat parties until their entire party is present. There was way too much haggling and open, unfilled seating by incomplete parties. Seat the complete and present parties first and skip over uncommitted customers who don't have everyone present. \\n\\n2) Shift non-customer facing / non-dining tasks to before and after customer dining hours. You don't need to check every single table and see if it wobbles, and then arduously flip over each table and adjust the foundation every time a customer leaves. Feed the people, get paid and get them out the door (full and happy) and do these maintenance type task items later. They can wait.\\n\\n3) Diffuse decision making by delegating. It became clear to me that one person was directing every single small decision on both the dining floor and in the back kitchen. Give your staff autonomy and let them make the decisions that best serve the customers that are immediately in front of them. Train them properly and trust that they will make the right decisions. This will speed up operations.\\n\\n4) You need to do something to appease diners who are waiting for long periods of time. Give them tea or whatever. Give tastings of particular appetizers you are trying to promote for the evening. Have someone present at the host / hostess station to ensure people have someone to talk to. Waiting is part of the dining experience and shouldn't be ignored.\\n\",\n",

The Bistro side is much better in terms of noise and it while offers less ambience, I don't miss what the other side is offering.

They're the same as the pascale mark except they have the black beans and roasted pineapple added in. Out of the two, I prefer the GLD and found the beans and roasted pineapple really added a little umph to it. So good. \\n\\n- the quesadilla was delicious. I added the tofu on it. It mimicked meat which was strangle but was quite tasty. I haven't had that exact flavor profile before anywhere else and it was interesting in a good way.\\n\\n- the ginger beer didn't taste anything like ginger beer. It actually tasted like a fizzy chai with zero ginger. I was thrown off and wondered if I got the wrong drink. I didn't finish mine.\\n\\n- the horchata with almond milk tasted really watery. Horchata is supposed to be creamy (not consistency wise) and bursting with cinnamon and awesomeness. The horchata just tasted like Almond Breeze with some cinnamon sprinkled on the top. Definitely not a fan.\\n\\n- the margaritas on the other hand...oh my - SO GOOD. We got three different flavors and they were all excellent. \\n\\n\\nNot a fan that the tables are so tight together. We sat next to a first date and the tension was fierce. We felt so uncomfortable. We felt like offering her an out because the guy was intolerable. No one thinks it's awesome that you regularly drink 20 beers in one sitting. I digress.\\n\\n\\nThe real reason I had trouble with this review is that while being a fan of the nachos, the quesadilla and the baked burrito (my partner gets it every time), our stomachs weren't fans of the food. Within less than 30 minutes of both meals I've had here, I was in the washroom. My partner always has acid reflux after every meal. Our friend was also hanging out on the toilet at home after his meal. We went home and I hung out there as well. We don't need to mention the gas, so we'll leave it at that. We don't have this issue at other Mexican style restaurants so we know that's not it. \\n\\nTwo other things to mention:\\n\\n- the prefilled water glasses at the front for the hostess/host to take when seating people. I was drinking my glass when I was seated at my table and noticed something small floating it in. Don't know if it's from the glass not being cleaned well and that was food remnants or what. \\n\\n- the fork had leftover food remnants that were't cleaned off and was dried on. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR: The food is delicious but our stomachs weren't happy with it.

              " (\"**Don't come here** if you are looking for Mexican food with meat.  The most important thing to consider before you come here, is that this is a vegan place, not a usual Mexican place. I see a lot of rave reviews down the list here but I think it's time someone gave a bit more of the unvarnished truth.\\n\\nOne reviewer mentioned that this place isn't all that clean. Well - he's right. You might be thinking that you shouldn't be expecting a whole lot because well, it's a restaurant along the Commercial Drive strip and it's just ummm...going to be that way. But somehow I'm not sure it has to be that way. Some might see this as part of the restaurant's charm, but if this is true, charm only goes so far.\\n\\nOne look at the dried spots on the cutlery and that kinda tells you everything you need to know. Along with the rather cramped seating(we were seated at a two-top by the window, with a 4-top seated immediately to my left - when they got up, their chairs banged into mine) and *very* loud music, things were not too comfortable. We knew immediately that we needed to place our orders, eat and leave.\\n\\nWe ordered nachos, baked burrito and fajitas. The nachos turned out to be the highlight of the dinner. They were excellent and reason enough on their own, to come here. The fajita was so-so, quite bland to be honest. The Tapatio hot sauce(not all that hot - more sweet than spicy) was basically mandatory, then OK the fajita was all right.\\n\\nBut the baked burrito was pretty terrible. It was outright tasteless, and not even our new friend Tapatio could save it. Now I don't know if vegan food is supposed to be like this, but when I've had even say, grilled mushroom appetizers that put this entire burrito to shame...it needs to be said. That burrito was not good, at all. We couldn't even eat a quarter of it before deciding to just brown bag it because we didn't want to waste the food(turned out my in-laws didn't like it either).\\n\\nSo. Probably a place for the die-hard vegan audience but for the rest of us - sorry to say this but you'll actually be happier with fake Mexican food from Taco Luis.\\n\",\n",

While the food is still good, I was disappointed with the price hike. I understand that prices are bound to increase with everything so expensive now, but my $18 beef bulgogi was small and did not have a lot of protein (mostly caramelized onion). Ive been to other restaurants that charge around $15 or so for a bigger portion. Still like this restaurant, but won't say it's my favourite anymore! :(\\n\",\n",

I mean, the food looked crazy appetizing on Yelp so why not?\\nThe place is somewhat small, but was pretty fancy and modern, from the decor to the table setting. \\n\\nWe ordered the Full Course Dinner: Dinner for Four, which included Mandoo (8pc), Jap Chae, Beef Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Bulgogi, and L.A. Kalbi. All for $65!\\n\\nOverall, the food looked amazing. \\nBanchan - Wow, the banchan was just so flavorful, especially the fish cakes, and the kimchi was on point.\\nMandoo - Delicious! Fried perfectly, the filling was great, and went well with the sauce. \\nJapchae - Super enjoyed this, and you get a pretty generous proportion too. The glass noodles were nice and lightly chewy with a good amount of beef and veggies, especially the wood ear mushrooms. Yum!\\nSoondubu - Average. I've had better. \\n\\nBefore we get into the meat dishes, can I just say that the two dishes (spicy pork & beef bulgogi) that I was looking forward to the MOST turned out to be the worst...\\n\\nSpicy Pork - Where's the meat? There was barely any in this, just a ton of onions. Interesting that there were rice cakes in it too, never had it like that before. Flavor was good though. \\nBeef Bulgogi - Again, WHERE'S THE MEAT? Why are there so much onions on both these dishes? I bet they put in rice cakes just to make up for the meat. There were only a few good size pieces on top. We had to scavenge through the onions to search for more, which turned out to be just tiny pieces left. You're really not getting your money's worth.  \\nKalbi - Not bad. The flavor was great, the meat was pretty tender, and I loved the grill marks on there. \\n\\nBottom line, it's not a Vancouver stop for me next time.\\n\",\n",

The fusion kind of put me off kilter considering Rangoli is his other restaurant which is a bit more classic.  The thing is that this restaurant pretty much has typical North American dishes but with the main Indian spices (curry, garam masala) and chutney sauce.  I think that fusion should be a bit more out of the box than this menu.  \\n\\nNow on to specific menu items, the lamb popsicles are the best menu item in my opinion.  They are cooked to a perfect medium rare and it's quite spectacular meat quality.  The pork spoon start is a nice small bite but it is extremely rich; the apple chutney gives it a tart but sweet finish.   I feel like the sablefish dish is a bit overpowered by the tomato broth considering it's such a delicate buttery fish that gets masked by any strong flavour like garama masala.  Mango lassi is like a rich mango milk somewhat smoothie type of drink that cools you down when there's anything super spicy you're trying out.\\n\\nVij's is a cool atmosphere with good service but in my opinion, the price range doesn't really reflect the elegancy of the food.\\n\",\n",

Thankfully a credit card and driver's license worked but one of my friends only had a driver's license so she didn't get to order any adult beverages. Sad. For drinks I got the White Girl W@$ted cocktail (vodka, lemonade, soda). A single is $7. And let me tell you, that glass was tiny! Cute but tiny. And there is no way I was going to get wasted off of one of those, it was very weak (but tasty). I would probably have to drink 10 to actually get drunk, not even kidding. So maybe stick to beer, unless you enjoy weak drinks. \\n\\nFor food I ordered three vegetarian tacos--mugroso--topped with avocado cream for a total of $8.50. The mugroso tacos (warm soft corn tortillas) are filled with veggie bean chili, veggies, rice, roasted corn, zucchini and tomatillo salsa. They were okay, not bad. Definitely edible. They were strikingly similar to my mom's vegetarian chili which is not amazing. Sorry mom. Some hot sauce helped the situation out a little bit. There was still room in my stomach so I ordered chips and those were pretty good... warm and lightly salted... multiple colors of chips too! I do love my chips. \\n\\nService was okay, our waiter could have been a littleee friendlier/nicer but oh well. \\n\\nI'd come back, probably for some late night snackage after drinking because they are open to 1 or 2 am which is nice. \\nP.S. One of my friends loved this place. Said it reminded her of Taco Bell which I guess is a great thing according to her haha.\\n\",\n",

Most places usually use syrup for flavoring and they use powder here. My friend and I got the supreme milk tea with boba. They were super backed up on orders so it took about 15-20 minutes to receive the drinks. Upon initial sip, I didn't know what to think. It didn't taste like milk tea, but it wasn't good either. There is a slight nutty/almond aftertaste and lingers in your mouth for awhile. Since they use powder, the texture was pretty chalky as well. Boba was okay. More on the soft than chewy side. I've had better boba that was $3 versus the hefty price for this $6 boba.\\n\\nI honesty don't see what the hype is. Service was pretty bad, and the workers speak to you in both Chinese and English.

When the first late party arrived, the chef decided to make the rest of us wait after piece #3 (I think) and catch them up to speed. That's fine, it's just 6 pieces he had to make.

This restaurant has an interesting shared tasting menu concept at for CAD 65 per person. We were able to finish the meal in about two hours. My favorite items were the oyster shooters and the sautéed mushrooms (with squash puree, yuzu brown butter, and ramen egg). The ramen egg was cooked perfectly, and the yolk provided a really nice dipping medium for the mushroom. I also liked the slight char/wok fire taste on the mushroom. \\n\\nThere were 7 courses total -- a pickled starter dish, a salad, a squash dish, the mushroom dish, two proteins, and a dessert. The two proteins of the night were a poached halibut and seared duck. The halibut was a bit too meaty for my taste, and I wish the skin on the duck were crispier. There was also a missed opportunity to make the bok choy vegetables more vibrant. The dessert was pretty interesting, which was summer berries over some pound cake dusted with dehydrated raspberry. \\n\\nI guess that you get what you pay for, and while there were several courses, the quality of each course was somewhat lacking. I felt like I could have probably cooked some of the dishes, although the different puree sauces were a nice touch. Still, most of the dishes seemed pretty amateur -- like a slightly more refined home cooking. \\n\\nThe ambiance was really nice though, and I liked the interior decoration of the restaurant. They have a really nice bar, and the cocktails could be really good. They also have a happy hour menu, which is nice.

Usually some dim sum with any sort of meat in it are mixed with a bit of flour to make the meat stick together. Or, if it's an even better place, they will whack the meat until it becomes a paste with a more bouncy texture. However, here, they use so much flour to create some sort of solidified goop mixture. You taste less meat and more paste.  This was apparent in the beef ball, the siu mai, and the shrimp salad roll.  Usually when you bite into the shrimp roll, shrimp pieces fall out as whole pieces of meat, but this one was gelatinzed and glued into a whole.  The siu mai, if you open it up, you can see what they did. Instead of a minced pork mixture, they had strips of pork that were gelatinzed with shrimp and mushroom.

She got us some water when she had a chance - which was about 15 minutes after being there.\\n\\nFood: We ordered the butter chicken roti (it sounded like that was what pretty much everyone was ordering).  We ordered a 4 out of 6 on the spice scale and it was really more of a 5 or 6.  The flavor was good, but felt watered down with the potato which I've never had in any butter chicken dish (some of it was mashed which gave it a thicker consistency).  I'm used to butter chicken being more creamy.  But I was starving at that point and it was hot and the roti was tasty so I didn't mind.\\n\\nRecommendation: It's pretty good value for the price - about $12-$13 for a dish and if I lived in the area I would probably call in for take-out.

On the side were some sauteed mushrooms. This dish came with a small glass of marsala wine. This dishes was delicious.

I only got about 4 slices of the breast. My biggest concern was that the skin wasn\\'t crispy and the fat wasn\\'t rendered off nicely. It still had that chewy texture which I was not expecting.

I actually enjoyed this one. I love the pairing of the rib-eye with the Parmigiano on top. It was just a bit odd to see a steak topped with arugula but oh wells. \\n\\nTiramisu (2/5-$14): We got this dish to share and was expecting a square of Tiramisu but it was in a tiny mold with some whip on the side and tiny quenelle of chococlate sorbet. I\\'m glad I\\'m not chocolate fan. The tiramisu was not coffee based and tasted average at best with chocolate twists in one of the layers. I liked them \\'cause it give the cake some texture.

She continued to stand there at our table for at least 15 seconds with this smug look, hand on her hip. We initiated the conversation by asking her if she gives this special treatment to all of her patrons. She argued with us and stood by her decision stating she thought he was a non paying customer who came in off the street to use the washroom. We expressed our disappointment in her lack of judgment, customer service and piss poor attitude. As a manager myself, I am extremely appalled by her inability to manage.\\n\\nShe had made a huge mistake, didn\\'t own up to it, didn\\'t apologize for it, and added salt to the wound by saying \"well if I see a drunk person stumbling in from the street it is my duty to kick them out.\" Right, after two beers?

The tuna was a paler shade of pink/beige which is one of the indicators that it is lower grade.  The ahi tuna in Hawaiian Poke, even the cheap ones, are always red, even crimson.  We ordered ours on brown rice, but in hindsight, we should have ordered it with something with less carbs such as quinoa or kale.  Taste-wise, it neither excited nor offended.

When you go get sushi, you are paying for the ingredients, but also for the skill of a sushi chef to assemble said ingredients into a maki or nigiri.  That skill often requires years to master, so sushi chefs are obviously not paid minimum wage.  Poke bowl practitioners, on the other hand, only need to dole out the required quantities of ingredients into a bowl using pre-measured scoops.  They\\'re like Subway Sandwich \"artists\".  Poke bowl restaurants should be democratizing the \"sushi\" experience by making \"sushi-like food\" more affordable for everyone.  But, I imagine that these places are very lucrative because the prices are high, and the labour is cheap, meaning a large profit margin.  At $40 for two people, I\\'d rather go to a sushi place.

Would recommend, although it is pricey for the quantity of food. \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was definitely the chai tea latte. The price point was pretty standard for most cafes in Vancouver, especially downtown, but for what I got it wasn't at all worth it. The latte was really weak and milky, with barely any tea flavour. And it was SO. SMALL. If Starbucks can do a better chai tea latte than an independent cafe, I think the recipe needs a revisit.

However, we quickly found out that to get the $25 menu, you were severely limited in your options as the alternative appy/entree/dessert would be an additional $10, $15, and $5 more, respectively. We stuck with the base menu, which was the Celeriac Velouté, Black Truffle Pizza / Seafood Risotto, and Market Cheesecake.\\n\\nCELERIAC VELOUTÉ: Having no idea what a velouté was or tasted like, I didn't have many expectations going into this dish. It turned out to be a wonderfully creamy soup with finely chopped green apples to give it some brightness and textural variety. \\n\\nBLACK TRUFFLE PIZZA: Having seen this on my friends' social media, this was the dish I was expecting a wow factor from. Unfortunately, it was quite underwhelming, even with the finesse of the truffles, fontina cheese, and frisee lettuce. While I still enjoyed the flavour and the thin crust, I would hands down choose the risotto, if given the choice between the two again. \\n\\nSEAFOOD RISOTTO: This was spectacular! The rice was perfectly cooked, absorbing the rich fullness of the broth. I adored the plump mussels, the bites of halibut and steelhead, and the touch of dill cream. If I could eat a pot of this, I would, so compliments to the chef! It set a new standard of risotto for me. \\n\\nMARKET CHEESECAKE: Like each dish before it, the dessert was immaculately presented--from the dollops of marmalade to the light dusting beneath the cheesecake. Aside from the preserved kumquat, which was rather acidic for me, I enjoyed this dish. The cheesecake itself was soft and paired well with the firm, buttery crust, and the biscuit on top. \\n\\nAlthough I was not completely sold by the food or its value, I did appreciate the impeccable service and the gorgeous, upscale interior. I do think Market would be a solid choice to go to for a date night or a special occasion.

We were in the area and figured we couldn't go wrong with this esteemed little neighborhood restaurant, but it turned out to be so lacklustre. \\n\\nI think part of the reason why we had such a disappointing experience was because, other than checking in once after the appetizer was served and quality checking that one dish, the server never returned (we had to ask before we had our water glasses filled), and we weren't able to voice our opinions over our entrees nor order more wine. \\n\\nHaving both been servers in the past, my partner and I were surprised she never asked us about our food, or asked if we wanted more alcoholic beverages once we were finished with our wine glasses. We were there at dinner time, so it wasn't like they were close to closing time and wanting their guests to leave. \\n\\nThey were so seemingly dismissive of us, in fact, and so hard to flag down for something like ground black pepper for our meals, that we just asked for our bill and dessert packed to go; we just wanted to leave. \\n\\nNow as much as we were baffled by the poor service (and we weren't asking for much), this review is mostly about the bland food. \\n\\nIn pictures, the food looks fantastic, but everything was so, so bland. The appetizer, a seafood medley in a creamy broth, was the best dish. Maybe it set the bar too high, for after finishing that, we were so looking forward to our entrees that we were sorely disappointed. \\n\\nI ordered a beef short rib pasta, and in my mind, I was envisioning something savoury and slow-cooked melt-in-your-mouth tender beef. But what came out was a beautifully-presented beef pasta dish with chewy, dry beef, dry pasta, and minimal seasoning. We were waiting for the server to come by and quality check so that maybe we could've salvaged it with hot sauce or pepper or anything, but because she never did, I just slowly picked away at my dry pasta and tough beef. I ended up packing up 3/4 of it to go and discarded it once we got home. \\n\\nMy partner ordered the steak with scalloped potatoes, and again, it looked beautiful, but the cut of beef turned out to be one that was stringy and tough as well. He ordered it medium rare, and it was pink in the middle and bleeding a bit so it looked right, but once you bit into it, it was so tough to chew. The scalloped potatoes were also dry and under-seasoned. And once again, he did not have a chance to salvage his meal as the staff didn't give us a chance. \\n\\nOverall, very disappointing dinner, and for $150, most definitely not worth it.\\n\",\n",

The Chicken Masala was good, but not outstanding. The mushroom and eggplant in cashew sauce was a little disappointing. Bf loved the lamb curry and our favorite dish was the Spinach Paneer.

My husbands chicken curry tasted same as the lamb. Fish curry was good, everything was perfectly spiced, I specially like the coriander chutney which was tangy and spicy. \\nThings took a bad turn when my husband found hair in his mushroom soup. First all the servers were running here and there but no one was paying attention to us. It took us almost 10 min to finally get our servers attention. She just asked if we wanted her to replace the soup and if we wanted anything else. Since we had not eaten a lot of the things which were in our plate we said no, but after that she never came back again to ask us if we wanted to try something else. Had we not called her to complain about the hair, I guess she would not have asked us at all if we wanted to try anything else.\\n Then my husband got a fish bone in his salmon, seeing the reaction we got for the hair we didn't even bother saying anything about the bone.

The girl there barely put any ketchup on the fries and I asked for more since I had just moved and didn't have any ketchup at home in the new place yet.

I did read online that they no longer have a tasting menu, but I wanted to be sure, so I called in and checked. They said they still have it, but it\\'s not exactly the same as before. However, the price point was still $60-70 a person depending on what\\'s ordered, some of the dishes would be on the menu, and some not depending on what the kitchen had that day. She quoted that we could share a few appetizers, pastas, main, and dessert. That sounded fine to me, so I decided to go for my birthday dinner.\\n\\nThen, once seated at the restaurant, I again asked the waitress about their tasting menu. She explained pretty much the same thing, making it sound like they have a tasting menu still available and we could list our preferences on what we saw on their regular menu that seemed interesting, and then the kitchen would decide what else to add to the menu. She quoted 3 appetizers, 2 pastas, 1 main, 1 dessert to share between 3 people. We chose 2 appetizers and the main. She said we might get a different special main from the kitchen (we did not). I wish I had chosen more, because when the bill came, it turns out they just ordered us items off the regular menu and it was pretty much exactly the same as if we\\'d have chosen the items, except they chose 1 appetizer, 2 pastas, and 1 dessert to serve to us.

On to the food!\\n\\nAll of the dishes were very tasty, with the exception of the dessert. They had a prosciutto and burrata appetizer ($25) on special which I highly recommend. They fly their burrata fresh in from Italy. It\\'s so soft and delicious. We also had their parmesan souffles ($16 each) which were SO good, light, fluffy, and tasty. We tried their butter lettuce wedge salad ($15), which was also very fresh, crisp, and delightful. Then, we had their spinach dumplings ($23). Not something I\\'d normally order, and value wise, not something I\\'d get again. It comes with 4 pieces. The taste was good, very carb loaded. The second pasta we had was the Maltagliani all\\'americano ($23). The sauce was really good, so flavourful, and the pasta was fresh and had a good bite. We then had 2 portions of the hangar steak main ($34 each). This was a generous portion, with lots of pieces of well-cooked steak and a nice arugula salad. I did find they were quite generous with the cheese in all of the dishes that had cheese. Lastly, they served us a chocolate cake with poached pear for dessert ($10). This was the most disappointing finish to our meal, as this was not only dry, but there was not much chocolate flavour. It wasn\\'t a very decadent dessert, it almost tasted store-bought. Definitely do not recommend this cake, so minus another star.\\n\\nOverall, if you go in ordering the dishes you actually want to try, and avoid their \"tasting menu\", I think you\\'d have a great time. The flavours for their dishes (in exception of the chocolate cake) are really good. If only I had gone with ordering dishes on my own, I would have had a much better experience.

The black garlic oil simply adds a whole new dimension of wow to the already rich tonkotsu broth. If you're looking for something with more punch you can consider the tsukemen, or dipped ramen noodles. It is certainly a nice option with some hot and smokey broth for ramen to soak in. The bonito fish scent really shines through and you have the option of getting cold or warm ramen - I'd prefer the warm noodles so as to keep your soup broth warmer throughout your dining session!\\n\\nWhat's a ramen experience without gyozas?

Asked if available and jumped at the chance to have what seems like a special meal. Came with seaweed, bamboo shoots, leeks, and a piece of gai lan. The broth is pretty much the star of the dish. It's a mix of chicken and pork broth with a touch of garlic. Didn't really get much of a sense of the garlic but it was a tasty broth for sure. Had to stop myself from eating too much of it. Also enjoyed greatly the fact your first noodle refill is free. Their ramen noodles was done pretty well as I like them firm and met my expectations.\\n\\nCouple problems still for me. I was a bit surprised when I got one piece of cha-shu for my meal. I think my experience for the most part is getting somewhere in the area of 2-3 pieces as a base amount depending on the size. I got 1 piece of cha-shu that was leaning towards being a small slice. I had to stop myself from eating it and waiting until I got my refill of noodles. Leading towards my next problem, I was still pretty hungry after my meal. It didn't feel quite as filling of a meal and I don't think I should have to order more food to compensate as such.

Came here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend because its one of the few fine dining places I\\'ve ever heard of in Vancouver and wanted to try their steak. We came in and did not have to wait for the table because we had reservation. The service was good at first. The hostness was nice and the waitress had a friendly manner in answering our questions and showed us the different meat cuts that they have on their menu(using literal plastic-modeled meat cuts).I was very impressed. We ordered Medium(25% pink) Porterhouse with some sides, calamari, creamed corn, and some wine. Things started to get differently when we had to wait a very long time for our food to come. We understand making a perfect steak takes time but we waited for more than an hour. We looked around and noticed some other tables also had to wait that long too. Then we heard the table next to us giving complaints about the steak and the service to the waitress. At that time we just continued drinking our wine and did not bother much about these. Then the food came. The waitress cut the porterhouse on the side and it turned out to be Rare(90% pink)(you can see in the photo) but we decided to just try those anyway because we thought \"how bad could it be?\". We tasted it and it was that bad. The steak tasted very bland like there was no flavor to it and we figured it might be because it was too undercooked. So we asked the waitress about it. What she did next was kind of a unique experience for us. She took the meat cuts from our plate and told us they were going to grill the meat again. Moments later she came back with the steak and turned out it was unevenly cooked. Some parts are undercooked. Some parts are well-done. It was very hard to chew and the taste did not improve. We spoke to the waitress again but she did not respond to us. (Just nodded to us showing a sign of \"oh well its still good\") and we were baffled. But we did not bother complaining further. We just continued to enjoy our time with each other as it was my birthday and did not want to end the day with a bad vibe.

All of this sounds like a good idea in theory, but I\\'m not quite sure it works in execution.\\n\\nThe waffle is Belgium\\'s most famous export, divided into broad regional subcategories that have existed for hundreds of years: the Brussels waffle (gaufre molle) and the Liège waffle (gaufre au sucre). What\\'s the difference? Liège waffles are made with a yeast-based brioche dough and include pearls of sugar that crystalize on the waffle iron. The sugar hardens during the cooking process so they\\'re chewy on the inside and have a crisp, caramelized outside layer, much like crème brûlée. Size-wise they\\'re normally smaller and rounder than the Brussels waffle, which has a larger, rectangular shape. The light batter-based delight you have in the comfort of your home or in the barely wiped booths of your neighborhood IHOP covered with 5 pounds of whipped cream, powdered sugar, and fruits somewhat resembles the Brussels waffle. Lebeau sells both with the aforementioned toppings and fillings.\\n\\nSpeaking of neighborhoods, Patisserie Lebeau is located in what I can only describe as Exotic Car Row. Your view from inside is a McLaren dealership across the street, and you\\'ll pass Bugatti, Maserati, Ferrari, and Lamborghini dealers on your way to the front door. As such I expected flawless artisanal pastries providing sweet sustenance to those who are in the area to drop half a million on a car.\\n\\nWhat I got instead were two sad waffles for a total of $4.22 USD. The Liège waffles I ordered were displayed in a case of pastries made that morning. Typically enjoyed as a dessert or snack (rather than a breakfast food) in their native Belgium, good Liège waffles are often tasty even at room temperature since they\\'re brioche-like and full of glorious fat. As such the waffles were rich as expected but they were also, sadly, dry and lacking any texture on account of the cooled chocolate stuck to the tops, which essentially suppressed the sugary crispy exterior you normally enjoy with these. Thus both the dark chocolate orange and ruby chocolate varieties I tried were a disappointing mouthful, basically a dessert of wasted calories and bad first impressions.\\n\\nFor me, this entire concept would work better if the food was made to-order, but business seems to be prospering and other Yelpers primarily rave about the place, so I\\'ll just file \\'cold waffles\\' into the \\'not my thing\\' category and call it a day.

TO NOTE: these dishes were on the small size so...beware? the cocktail, which was called bite the bullet, was decent. 2nd dish was mackerel with chickpeas and cauliflower. i love sour stuff so i liked this dish the most - it was light and vinegary at the same time. cocktail for this was iron brew and it was def strong. p and i didn't like it but s drank it all for the team lol. last but not least, and this dish cant rly be shared but we didnt it anyways, arancini. basically this ball of winter squash stuff - it was good mind you but just hard to share. p and i loved the cocktail for this dish the most - rum around (prbly because i've recently acquired a taste for rum lately lol)\\n\\nnow onto the normal menu. we first ordered a cheese board, meatballs and skewers. the cheeseboard was good - the only cheese that i didn't have was blue cheese but both besties liked it so yay! the fig jam was great and i liked the sourdough bread pieces. when we asked for more, they came out warm and toasty frm the kitchen so that was a nice touch. meatballs were rather bland, tho p disagrees, but the tomato sauce that it came in was very good. we were all dipping some of the remaining bread into that sauce when we ate all the meatballs - you do get quick a bit, prbly ~10 bite-sized ones. now the skewers, we got all three to try and tbh i would advise to just order the meat ones (steak and lamb). the focaccia one was....i wouldn't say it's bad but the focaccia was too dry and the mozzarella didn't add much to it. there's also anchovies, which i'm ok with but i didn't feel like it was needed.\\n\\nafter this, we decided we should order more food lol so we got a 2nd round of skewers and the burrata. this is where things sorta went a little downhill with service. for the record, i was the only tipsy one cuz i kept hugging p that was sitting beside me and s was like she's tipsy. there was some miscommunication and misunderstanding with our 2nd skewers' order - we wanted only the meat ones but the waitress must have heard wrong or something. so s called her over and told her that, our waitress seemed to be put off by it and said that we can't rly take this back but we can take it off your bill. we agreed to that because well she didn't really give us much options here. there another guy, which we assumed was the mgr, came by and asked us why we didn't like the focaccia skewers and s explained. he then briskly walks away without saying anything and goes to the cashier area to, im assuming here, take the 3 skewers off. after that little drama, our burrata came. the burrata was good - i loved the pumpkin seed and squash crumble salad thing on top of the sourdough. however, this made the sourdough really hard to cut through, even with the steak knife that was given to us.\\n\\ni was finished all my drinks at this point and s was asking if i wanted a 2nd round. so i looked thru the drinks menu to see if they have the empress gin that i liked. the menu said victoria gin but i wasn't sure which one, so i tried to get our waitress but the mgr guy came instead cuz she wasn't around. i asked him abt the gin and he just bluntly answers no and walks off. i was pretty offended by that because normally, there would have been other suggestions made or some follow-up questions at least. \\n\\nall in all, the subpar service didn't really damper our evening but just something that needs to be worked on i guess?\\n\",\n",

Bone marrow did not taste fresh whatsoever. Broth was saltier than most.
